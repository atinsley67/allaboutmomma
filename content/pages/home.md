        text: >-
          One of my favorite things to do with my children is hike! Our love for
          hiking and desire to relive our hikes gave me and my little ones the
          idea to create a Momma and Toddler Hiking Journal.


          A space design for toddler and mom to journal their hikes together as
          well as spaces for planning, goal setting, scavenger hunts and more.
