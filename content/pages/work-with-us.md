      ## **Why Partner with All About Momma**


      Our objective is to inspire more families to travel and spend time in
      nature with their kids. Whether that be on a vacation, home or exploring
      the nearby area. 


      We work on finding the right products to enable outdoor living as a family
      and share those findings. We only work with companies we believe and see
      use in their products. 


      For our travel section we choose destinations that are family friendly and
      provide lots of time outside. Adventuring is our family style!


      ## Our Focuses 


      Travel Reviews: We give honest reviews of places we go with our family and
      small children. We primarily like to go places that enables lots of
      outdoor time, whether at a lake, beach or hiking in the mountains. 


      Hiking and Camping Information: Hiking and camping is a big part of our
      family life. Anything from product reviews to advice on how to hike with
      kids to state and national parks is up our alley.


      Cycling Information: Before having kids we took epic cycle tours. Now we
      focus on cycling with kids, whether on our bikes or finding the best bikes
      for our kids. 


      Family Outdoor Time: We are a huge advocate of spending more time outdoors
      and away from screens as a family. We focus on outdoor activities to keep
      kids entertained, to outdoor products and any fun in the sun.


      ## Happy To Collaborate 


      We love collaborating with companies and travel industries to help endorse
      outdoor family life. We see it as a way to help other families see what is
      possible and be inspired to spend more time outside.

      how we can collaborate together. Write "Future Collaboration" in the
