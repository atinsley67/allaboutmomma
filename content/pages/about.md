      # All About Momma


      Hello there, I'm Kristina, and I'm thrilled you have made it here! Here's
      a little peek into my world and journey I have taken to my role as  Chief
      Momma Adventurer, at least according to my kids.


      Before I was a mother, my husband and I lived an active lifestyle. I also
      craved new experiences which led me to accept a role based out of London,
      UK. There I joined the local Ultimate Frisbee team, where I met my now
      husband.


      After three years exploring Europe my husband and I's adventurous side led
      us to quiet out jobs to cycle across Asia, pedaling over 3,000 miles.
      After our cycle tour we moved to the United States.


      When I became a mother, I was determined to maintain an active lifestyle
      that included my children. Upon discovering I was pregnant I immediately
      researched jogging strollers, hiking backpacks and cycling seats for kids
      imagining the adventures we would have.


      Around the time of COVID-19 pandemic, I took the leap and quit my
      corporate life to fully embrace my role as Chief Momma Adventure and have
      more time at home with my kids. I have not regretted it for a second. My
      happiest moments are spent outdoors with my kids, and that is what I get
      to do now!


      All About Momma was created as a creative outlet for me to share my tips
      and tricks for other families to adventure more with their own children
      outside. Through my website, I hope to empower fellow moms to get outside
      and enjoy nature.


      In addition to my passion for outdoor exploration and family adventures,
      I'm excited to share my latest endeavor: unique interactive journals for
      kids, tailored specifically for hiking, camping, and outdoor adventures.


      Available now on
      [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Momma-Toddler-Hiking-Journal-interactive/dp/B0CHMHKDG6/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8\&qid=\&sr=),
      these journals are designed to spark creativity, foster curiosity, and
      document the  experiences of young adventurers. With prompts and
      activities inspired by nature, each journal encourages kids to engage with
      their surroundings, reflect on their adventures, and create lasting
      memories.


      I'm happy you are here and can't wait to hear about your family's
      adventure.


      Sincerley,

      Kristina

          Life is a grand adventure, and I believe in seizing every opportunity
          to make it extraordinary. With each new adventure, we have the chance
          to have new experiences, explore terrain, and create lasting family
          memories. 


          I am a firm believer in bringing your children along on the journey,
          discovering fresh perspectives and forging deeper connections as a
          family unit. Throughout my own family's adventures, I've learned how
          adaptable and resilience my children are. I have seen the growing joy
          that exploring nature and the world brings them which makes me one
          happy momma!

          There's a sense of peace and joy that surrounds us when we immerse
          ourselves in nature. From the open spaces to the gentle caress of
          fresh air and the warmth of the sun on our faces, every moment spent
          outdoors is a magical. 


          As a family, we've discovered that our happiest moments happen
          outdoors. By nurturing our children's love for the outdoors, we not
          only cultivate a deep appreciation for the natural world but also get
          to spend more time outside ourselves.

          There's nothing quite like the joy of experiencing life alongside your
          family, witnessing the growth, development, and journey of each
          cherished member. As a mother, I am filled with a sense of pride and
          gratitude as I watch my children navigate each phase of life. 


          There's a sweetness in living fully in the present moment, cherishing
          the simple life that come with each day around those you love.
