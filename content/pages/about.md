      # All About Momma

      Hello there, I'm Kristina, and I'm thrilled to welcome you to my corner of
      the digital world! Here's a little peek into my journey and how I
      transitioned from corporate life to becoming the Chief Momma Adventurer.


      Before my journey into motherhood, my husband and I led an active
      lifestyle. I've always had a passion for sports, which seamlessly
      transitioned into my corporate life. A twist of fate led me to London,
      where I immersed myself in the finance industry and discovered the
      exhilarating world of Ultimate Frisbee, where I met my now husband.


      Our thirst for adventure led us to embark on a cycling tour across Asia,
      pedaling over 3,000 miles with our belongings strapped to our bikes. After
      settling in the United States, I continued to fuel my passion for running,
      completing marathons in iconic locations like Rome and Napa Valley.


      When parenthood beckoned, I was determined to maintain an active lifestyle
      that involved my growing family. My journey into motherhood began with a
      Bob jogging stroller purchase, and from there, I delved into hiking,
      camping, and exploring the great outdoors with my little ones in tow. I
      discovered the joy of cycling with my kids, witnessing their excitement as
      they experienced the freedom of two wheels for the first time.


      As the COVID-19 pandemic reshaped our lives, I shifted my focus from
      corporate endeavors to embracing the role of a stay-at-home mom. My
      happiest moments are spent outdoors with my kids, and I'm passionate about
      instilling a love for nature in my children from an early age, rain or
      shine.


      Through my website, I aim to empower fellow moms to navigate the beautiful
      chaos of motherhood while nurturing their love for the great outdoors. I
      hope to inspire moms to embark on adventures with their children,
      regardless of their age or the weather outside. Together, let's raise a
      generation of outdoor-loving kids and share the tidbits of wisdom I've
      gathered along the way to help maintain balance amidst the chaos of family
      life.


      In addition to my passion for outdoor exploration and family adventures,
      I'm excited to share my latest endeavor: unique interactive journals for
      kids, tailored specifically for hiking, camping, and outdoor adventures. 


      Available now on
      [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Momma-Toddler-Hiking-Journal-interactive/dp/B0CHMHKDG6/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8\&qid=\&sr=),
      these journals are designed to spark creativity, foster curiosity, and
      document the unforgettable experiences of young adventurers. With prompts
      and activities inspired by nature, each journal encourages kids to engage
      with their surroundings, reflect on their adventures, and create lasting
      memories. From recording their favorite hiking trails to sketching the
      wildlife they encounter, these journals serve as a treasure trove of
      memories that will be cherished for years to come. 


      I'm genuinely grateful for your presence here, and I can't wait to embark
      on this journey together!


      Sincerley,

      Kristina

          Life is better outdoors. The open space, fresh air and sun shining
          down on you brings happiness, at least to this family.


          Encourage your little ones love for the outdoors and you will also
          benefit in more outdoor time and vitamin D.

          Nothing is better than getting to experience life the way you enjoy
          with your family. Watching as your littles grow, develop and find
          their place.


          As a mom I cannot be more proud of my kids during each phase. There is
          nothing sweeter than living in the present.
