        text: >-
          Encourage your young explorer to take on many outdoor adventures with
          our "First Hiking Journal" designed for kids 4-12 to complete on their
          own. Here is a place just for kids to explore, record, and remember
          while hiking. 


          This hiking journal doesn't just allow your child to record their
          hikes, but includes fun interactive pages. Scavenger hunts, nature
          drawings, hiking games, tree identification and more can be found in
          this 80 page book. 


          The hiking logs is a 3 page spread per hike that even a younger child
          can fill out themselves. Many prompts to circle items instead of
          writing out and spaces for drawings on the hike. This is a unique and
          fun journal to accompany your little adventurer.

      - title: Momma and Toddler Hiking Journal Paperback
        text: >-
          One of my favorite things to do with my children is to hike. Our love
          for hiking gave us the inspiration to create this one of a kind
          interactive Momma and Toddle Hiking Journal.


          It not only has a space for me, momma, to record our time together,
          but areas my toddler can contribute to. Space for them to remember
          with you the hike and recount which animals or bugs you saw along the
          way and information like weather, moods, fun rating and more. 


          Also comes with bonus pages such as scavenger hunts, drawing spaces
          and more!
