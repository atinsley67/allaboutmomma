          One of my favorite things to do with my children is to hike. Our love
          for hiking gave us the inspiration to create this one of a kind
          interactive Momma and Toddle Hiking Journal.


          It not only has a space for me, momma, to record our time together,
          but areas my toddler can contribute to. Space for them to remember
          with you the hike and recount which animals or bugs you saw along the
          way and information like weather, moods, fun rating and more. 


          Also comes with bonus pages such as scavenger hunts, drawing spaces
          and more!

          A purely unique journal that your toddler and you create together. A
          great spot for all your hikes and adventures and a way to reinforce
          those memories so you can relive them over and over again!


          "The next best thing to the enjoyment of a good time is the
          recollection of it." -James Lendall Basford


          The hardcover version is exactly the same as the paperback, either way
          you cannot go wrong!
