Books are magical. They fire up a child’s imagination and pull them away into another world.  Books can help introduce new concepts to toddlers and demonstrate new behaviors.  If your toddler loves to go hiking or you want to introduce the love of hiking then books about hiking are perfect. 

My 3 kids love being read to. Being an outdoor enthusiast myself I enjoy books about outside adventure. I have scoured the libraries and book stores to find the best hiking books for toddlers. These books are great conversation starters for my toddlers on hiking.

## **What are the Benefits of Reading to a Toddler?**

Reading is one of the best things you can do for your toddler and your toddler’s development. It doesn’t just provide closeness as you snuggle in together to read, but much more. According to **[Kids Health](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/reading-toddler.html)** additional benefits of reading to toddlers are: 

- Improves vocabulary

- Introduces the concept that words are made up of smaller sounds

- Familiarizes them with letters and words 

- Provides a method for toddlers to learn about the world

- Strengthens concepts toddlers are learning (shapes, numbers, etc.)

- Relates stories to things occurring in a toddler’s life (emotions, going to preschool, etc.)

- Strengthens your bond with your child

## **Can a Toddler go on a Hike?**

Of course! **[Hiking with a Toddler](/hiking-with-toddlers-ultimate-guide/)** is a great activity to do outside. I suggest investing in a **[hiking backpack](/best-back-carrier-for-toddler-while-hiking/)** for Mom or Dad so when your toddler needs a rest or the trail becomes difficult you can carry them.

![toddlers can hike photo](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975373/can-toddlers-go-on-a-hike.jpg "My 2 and 4 year old on an autumn hike in the Catskills")

Before going on a hike with a toddler make sure your expectations are in line. You will not be able to go as far as you normally would as your toddler will want to hike at least a part of the way.  Pick your trails with your child in mind (if there is water along the trail that will be an added bonus).  

There are always important things to take on a hike with a toddler besides a hiking backpack.

### The Items I take on all my Hikes with Toddlers are

- Portable Diaper Pad

- Wipes

- Diapers

- Small first aid kit

- Water

- Snacks

- Change of clothes for the car

Check out **[Toddler Hiking Gear](/equipment-needed-to-hike-with-your-toddler/)** for more information.

## **What Should a Toddler Wear on a Hike?**

**[Dressing your toddler](/how-to-dress-baby-toddler-hiking/)** right for hiking is essential. When toddlers get cold or wet they can be cranky, just like adults. Making sure your toddler will stay dry and warm is critical for hiking success.

![how to dress a toddler for a hike](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975374/how-to-dress-a-toddler-for-hiking.jpg)

I love **[trail hiking pants](/best-toddler-hiking-pants-for-outdoor-toddlers/)** for my toddlers. My favorite pair are **[Oaki Trail and Hike pants](https://www.amazon.com/Oakiwear-Childrens-Trail-Pants-Glacier/dp/B0773CB26F?crid=3LUW7L41QCOKW&keywords=Oakiwear%2Bchildren%E2%80%99s%2Btrail%2Band%2Brain%2Bpants&qid=1642555061&sprefix=oakiwear%2Bchildren%2Bs%2Btrail%2Band%2Brain%2Bpants%2Caps%2C128&sr=8-2&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=29310e31f82b9caf8edd31d8d7e7d65c&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)**. These pants are waterproof and can go on overtop their normal clothes. When they are wearing them I do not worry about them splashing in mud, sitting in puddles or brushing up against the foliage. They are protected!

In warmer months of the year a good pair of **[hiking sandals](/best-toddler-hiking-shoes-sandals-and-boots/)** goes a long way. Both my boys and myself have **[Keen hiking sandals](https://www.amazon.com/KEEN-Newport-Depths-Gargoyle-Toddler/dp/B07DK3G765?crid=1GE18ZYPH040H&keywords=keen+water+sandals+toddlers&qid=1665668635&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjUzIiwicXNhIjoiMC4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMDAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=keen+water+sandals+toddlers%2Caps%2C85&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=cb6008c610ba7a2012e8d375f67b78ca&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)**. The sandals are comfortable, durable and great in water. My toddlers can walk through the creek beds and rivers and the sandals provide them stability and protection.

## **How to get a Toddler to Enjoy Hiking?**

Reading is a great start, and hiking books for toddlers are golden. Luckily there are many other things you can do as well to get your toddler excited about hiking. 

One method is through example. If you incorporate hiking into your family lifestyle then your child will get on board. Toddlers like routine and if they know they get to go on hikes often they will anticipate the next hike!

Bring family members and friends. Toddlers love having their "favorite people" around and will love taking their "grandma" on a hike.

Bring a toddler camera and let them document their hike. Or binoculars to find animals, birds or insects along the way.

This board book is a great celebration of some of the National Parks. The book takes you through several different parks and focuses on the wildlife in each park..

It can help a toddler understand that there are many national parks and each one is unique with its own wildlife. After reading the book ask which park your toddler wants to visit!

  
This book is also great once you start visiting some of the parks. The parks included are some of the more famous ones and my husband and I have taken our kids to a few of them. My oldest (4 years) remembers being at several of the parks which makes the book even more special to him.

This book is a sweet story of three girl friends who are going on a hike with their dog. The story is more realistic of a whole day hiking with some complications that occur, such as getting lost on the trail. 

The story is geared for an older toddler and shows some fun things to do on a hike. You can identify the birds, look for animal prints and find wild berries. The three girl’s different personalities shine through in this book, but all types like to hike.

This book is geared towards the older toddler or preschooler and a great hiking book for toddlers. It is the journey of a grandma who hikes the whole Appalachian trail after she discovers no woman has ever accomplished it. It provides lots of facts about the Appalachian trail and goes through the states and terrain of the journey.

It is a great way to explain how hiking can be a multi-day or month-long journey. Perhaps set a primer that they might go on day long hikes.

This is the longest book in my list, but I love setting the scene where a person can hike long distances no matter their age.

Hope this inspired you to get a great hiking book for toddlers and start reading today!
