title: 'Great Wolf Lodge Poconos: Family Review'

The Great Wolf Lodge was one of those places that everyone talks about, but was hesitant to go to for our family. I often chose trips for the family focused on outdoor activities such as hiking and camping. However, I wanted to test the hype of Great Wolf Lodge and get a reprieve from the cold winter weather outside. 




The Great Wolf Lodge is one of those places that has everything you need within the resort; food options, water park, scheduled activities for families and additional add on activities. When you book your stay the waterpark entrance and scheduled activities are free, but you will pay for food and other activities you choose to partake in.




Overall the Great Wolf Lodge in Poconos Pa was a hit for my three kids, aged 1,3 &5 at the time, my mom and myself. There are some things we would have done differently, but can fix those items for the next visit. 




Read along to see my honest review, what to expect and things I would have done differently.




Great Wolf Lodge Poconos Pa: Hotel Rooms




The Great Wolf Lodge has many different room types to accommodate different size families. The most expensive being a Villa, followed by the tower and then the lodge. The villas are large multiple room spacious options for large family gatherings. The tower offers more modern new rooms, with cute kid details, such as a bear den bunk bed option. The lodge is the basic room type, which I stayed in with my family.




The lodge is slightly dated, but perfectly adequate for a stay with kids. I stayed in a room with two queen beds and a couch pulled out. The room was larger than the average hotel room and came with a mini fridge, a TV in the bedroom section and in the smaller living room section.




The room was clean and we had no major concerns. It was easy access to the rest of the lodge, waterpark, restaurants and activities. We spend very little time in our rooms, mainly to sleep and as a place to change during the day when changing activities.




Key Items to Bring to Great Wolf Lodge with Kids

* Water Shoes
* Easy Bathing Suit Cover Ups
* Water Bottles
* Waterproof Phone Cover
* Goggles




Great Wolf Lodge Poconos Pa the Waterpark




The main attraction of Great Wolf Lodge is the indoor waterpark. I have never taken my kids to a waterpark yet and with my kids so young I wasn't sure how it would go over.  They absolutely loved the water park and each found things they loved suited to their age.




There was truly something fun for all kids and ages. My youngest, being 1.5 years old, had a great time in the Cub Paw Pool. Here the water was 18 inches with some water play structures to keep little ones entertained. Also the smaller slides at Chinook Cove, wave pool and lazy river were her main attractions.




My boys’ ultimate favorite was Fort Mackenzie and the slides at the top. Other favorites were the lazy river, wave pool and some of the larger tube slides. My boys spent over an hour each day in the Chinook Cove basketball area making friends and playing.




There are food options in the waterpark that are typical of fast food options, chicken nuggets, burgers, pizza, fries and similar foods.




My mom and I did enjoy a nice frozen daiquiri one day lounging near the wave pool. 




Tips for the Water Park at Great Wolf Lodge with kids

* Do not bring towels, they provide you one towel per person
* Life Jackets are available to kids at no costs
* To get a table arrive early 
* Food and drink available in water park area
* Bring a water proof phone case if you want to take pictures




Free Activities at Great Wolf Lodge Poconos




The Great Wolf Lodge has daily free activities for kids. These include story times, arts n crafts, bingo and ends each day with a Dance Party. 




These are great events that will NOT cost you and a great way to meet other families or have time outside the waterpark. 




My kids loved the dance party! It does start at 8 pm which is past my kids bedtime of 7 pm. We stayed up two of the three nights for this, but my daughter fell asleep on me each time. On weekends this is a very popular event and will get crowded! 




Make sure to check the schedule each day as the times do change. 




Great Wolf Lodge Pocono MagiQuest




MagiQuest is a fun magical adventure that fills the halls of the Great Wolf Lodge. This is NOT included in your room rates.




I was skeptical about the MagiQuest, I felt everywhere we went, besides the Water park everything was an additional cost, but we did end up buying one wand. Since my kids were young, 5 and younger, they were not able to understand “the quest” and help save the Sacred Trees.




For younger kids they suggested not buying the full experience but rather the “mini Magi Mode”, this mood allowed my kids to wave their interactive wands at the treasure and hear the sounds go off, but not embark on the whole journey. It also reduced costs. 




What you need to know about MagiQuest at Great Wolf Lodge

* MagiQuest fills the halls of the Great Wolf Lodge  (your kid will see it)
* 1 wand per family is sufficient to save costs
* Younger kids can purchase Mini Magi Mood 
* Wands can be brought back for next visit




Olivers Mining Co at Great Wolf Lodge Poconos




I don’t know what it is about mining for “gems”, but this activity my kids always gravitate towards. I personally feel just getting rocks that will clutter my house is not worth it, but I am always overruled.




Again this is not a free activity, but something you can add on to your stay. I was pleasantly surprised by this experience. I envisioned paying my fees to get the bag of rocks and sand to mine for and that would be all. 




Before mining for gems you get to first walk through the Moonstone Mine Mirror Maze. This interactive experience had my kids working together to escape. After we completed and escaped we then mined for “gems” and were able to take them home.


My kids have “gem boxes” at home. These boxes we created after we first visited Crystal Caves and mined for gems. We got a wooden box and allowed each kid to decorate their box. Now whenever we get cool rocks, gems or unique small items my kids have a place to keep them together. 




Take Aways from Olivers Mining Co at Great Wolf Lodge

* Pay for attraction
* Pay for small or large bag to “mine for gems”
* Purchase one large bag for all kids to save costs
* Bags include admission to Moonstone Mine Mirror Maze
* On basement level and if you don’t go looking for it your kid will not know it is there




Ten Paw Alley at Great Wolf Lodge Poconos




This bowling alley isn’t like a normal one, which has its pluses and minuses. It is smaller, with smaller lanes, balls and frames. It makes it easier for younger kids to partake and doesn’t require bowling shoes!




I was happy to realize bowling at first seemed cheap, at $7 bucks a round per person. But I didn’t know a round was only 5 frames, by the time the kids were just getting into it the game was over. 




Takeaways from Ten Paw Alley at Great Wolf Lodge Poconos

* Great ball size for young kids to play (1 year old took part)
* A game was only 5 frames instead of 10
* Suggest only the kids play to save costs




Moon Glow Golf




Another paid activity you can do is Moon Glow Golf. This is a 9 hole putt putt course that has glow in the dark features. I didn’t take part in this. With my kids' young age I didn’t find it was worth paying the fee for.




Also at some stage if you say yes to each activity you will be racking up costs quite quickly.




Northern Lights Arcade




Arcades, Arcades, Arcades. These are my worst nightmares with young kids. This arcade is located right outside the waterpark and will be seen by your kids. My kids were begging and begging to take part in this activity.




I tried super hard to stick to my guts with a hard no, but caved. I wish I didn’t cave. After loading up both my boys (ages 3 and 5)  cards to have $15 dollars, we let them choose games to play. This arcade is stacked with the classic Claw game. This game is the worst, you get one go and you NEVER get the prize.




After my 3 year old spent nearly all his money on the Claw I had to carry him out full fledged crying, kicking and screaming. He did not win, he wanted more money and it only took him less than 5 minutes to spend all the money.




My 5 year old stayed away from the Claw game, but still spent all his money in less than 10 minutes and was not happy with his “prize pickings”.




I think arcades are the worst value for money, and often lead to tantrums and frustration. My advice: stay away from the arcade! Make up any excuse to not play any games!




Take Away from Northern Lights Arcade

* Unless you want to spend lots of money, stay AWAY!
* Will result in toddler tantrums




Build-A-Bear Workshop at Great Wolf Lodge




In the main gift shop on the main floor is a Build-a-bear workshop. It looked standard to build-a-bears I used to see in shopping malls. I didn’t allow my kids to take part, again at some stage you have to stop the unlimited spending of money!




Food Packages at Great Wolf Lodge Poconos




When you purchase your room you will be offered the option of a meal plan. In the hotel there are two main restaurants, Timbers Table and Kitchen and Fireside. 




The one thing I disliked is that a meal package forced you to eat at the same restaurant each breakfast and dinner. Both packages include a buffet style breakfast and credits to use for lunch and dinner per person.




We purchased the Fireside dining option. The breakfast was delicious and came with unlimited refills of any of the dishes brought out. My kids particularly loved the mini muffins. For lunch you got credit for food stands in the waterpark and dunkin donuts. Dinner was then at Fireside, every night!




Overall the food was decent, but it was too much food for a family with three small kids. We could have spent less money and just purchased food for each meal. If you are visiting with older kids, it might be worth it, but next time I would not get the meal plan. 




Attraction Passes




You will have the option to purchase an Attraction Pass when you book your room. These will give you certain activities your child can take part in during your stay




The Pup pass is for the youngest age (toddlers) and includes:

* One Build-a-Bear (without outfit)
* One small candy cup
* One Kid’s ice cream
* $5 Northern Lights Arcade Credit

 

For that price I do NOT feel that is a good deal (and $5 Arcade Credit will not last more than 2 minutes and end in tears)




The Paw pass is designed for kids of any ages and includes:

* One MagiQuest Game
* Choice of wand or belt to play MagiQuest
* Great Wolf Swim Goggles
* One Small Candy Cup
* One Kid Ice Cream
* $5 Northern Lights Arcade Credit
* One Leather Treat Name Bracelet




Again I do not find this a great value. 




The Wolf Pass offers the most things and of course is the most expensive. This includes:

* One MagiQuest Game
* Choice of wand or belt to play MagiQuest
* One Build-a-Bear (without outfit)
* One small candy cup
* One Kid’s ice cream
* $5 Northern Lights Arcade Credit
* One Leather Treat Name Bracelet
* One Howl in One Mini Golf
* One game at Ten Paw Alley
* One Admission to Moonshine Mining




Again I wouldn’t buy, but if you plan to do all those activities this bundle will save you money. 




Would I go to Great Wolf Lodge Poconos again with kids?




Absolutely, the kids had a great time and I did too, at the water park. Now that I have experienced several of the paid activities I would do things differently next time. 




What would I do differently next time I visit Great Wolf Lodge Poconos?




I would set the expectation with my kids of what we are going to do at Great Wolf Lodge. The most fun we had was at the Water Park and that is the ONLY thing included in your room rate. I will let them know this is our main activity and hype up all the fun the water park offers. 




I would NOT purchase a meal plan. We didn’t end up spending all the credits with a family with small kids and wasted a lot of food. We will buy food for meals when needed and also pack kids snacks to fill gaps.




I would only let my kids pick ONE additional activity. There is plenty of fun with free activities and water parks that you shouldn’t have to spend an arm and leg on additional activities. And these must be agreed upon before we visit.




NO WAY am I stepping inside the Northern Lights Arcade again. Not happening, will for me! 




Will let me kids do any free activities they want to. And the Dance Party is a must do! But we will bring our own bubble wands!




Arrive at the water park as it opens to secure a table for the day. Eating lunch is way easier with kids at a table then lounge chairs.
