## How To Create A Christmas Tree Ornament With A Toddler, Preschooler or Kindergartener

### Collect Nature Material

One of the most fun steps of a nature craft is collecting your material. You can either go on a hike or wander around your yard to find what you will need.

![Nature craft collecting of sticks for tree](http://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1688514327/collecting_sticks_for_nature_craft_iewria.jpg "Finding all the sticks")

Sticks are commonplace and you should have no problems finding them. However, you will have to be on the lookout for a holly tree to gather your berries. I have one in my backyard so for me this is easy. 

If you can’t find a holly tree you can also use pom pom balls, any other berry you can find outdoors or at the store

### Bake the Sticks to Clean Them

You never know what is living on sticks. Since this is a Christmas tree ornament we want to make sure that we aren’t bringing anything inside. 

![baking our sticks for nature craft with toddlers](http://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1688514528/baking_sticks_r3keob.jpg "Sticks on our baking tray")

Place the sticks on foil in a baking sheet. Bake for 30 minutes at 250. 

### Break the Sticks to Appropriate Lengths 

Line up the sticks on your popsicle stick or piece of wood and determine the best sizes for each stick. The longer sticks on the bottom with the shortest sticks on top to create a Christmas Tree. Leave some room at the top for a bow and hole for hanging.

I like to break the sticks to appropriate lengths then have my kids place them in order from longest to shortest. Always good to turn an activity into a mini lesson!

### Glue Sticks to Assemble a Tree

I find a glue stick or liquid glue doesn’t work it to keep the sticks in place. I use the glue gun  for this nature craft. This does mean I have to be extra careful with my toddler or preschooler.

I suggest operating the glue gun and having your child place each stick done in place. 

Repeat till the tree shape is complete

### Decorate with Holly Berries

Again I find the glue gun the best for this job. Place a dollop of glue down on a stick or in between two sticks and have your child drop a berry or pom pom down. 

I like to let my kids pick where the berries should go and how many they find appealing.

### Make a Bow Top

Next you will want to add some flair to the top. Let your toddler/preschooler pick out their favorite ribbon color and use it to tie a bow.

### Punch a Hole in the Stick for Easy Hanging

Lastly, you need a way to hang your ornament on the tree. Punch a hole out of the popsicle stick to thread a string to hang.

Voila you have a perfect Christmas tree ornament made from nature!
