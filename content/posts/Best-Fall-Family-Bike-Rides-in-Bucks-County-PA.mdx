Bucks County, PA, transforms into a breathtaking wonderland during the fall season, making it one of the best times of the year to explore its family-friendly bike trails. The crisp autumn air and vibrant foliage create a stunning backdrop for your family bike adventures.

Whether you're riding along a river, through a park, or down tree-lined paths, there's a trail for every family and their abilities. In this post, we’ll cover the best family fall rides in Bucks County and I will offer my personal advice on choosing the perfect trail for different age groups.

My family and I live in Bucks County and fall is our ultimate favorite season to bike in. The trees are spectacular, the weather is perfect and there are so many great options for a family bike ride. 

## When is Peak Fall Foliage in Bucks County Pa?

The best time to experience peak fall foliage in Bucks County, PA, is typically from mid-October to late October. However, the exact timing can vary slightly based on the year’s weather conditions. Here’s a general timeline:

<OutlineBox>
  * Early October: Leaves start changing, especially in northern and higher-elevation areas of the county.
  * Mid to late October: This is usually the peak time, when trees are at their most vibrant, displaying a stunning mix of reds, oranges, and yellows.
  * Early November: The foliage begins to fade, with some trees losing their leaves, but you can still find patches of color in certain areas.
</OutlineBox>

Cooler temperatures, sunny days, and the region's natural beauty make this the ideal time for a family bike ride in Bucks County.

## What to Bring on a Family Bike Ride?

When heading out on a family bike ride, it’s important to be prepared for safety, comfort, and fun. Here’s a list of essentials to bring on a family-friendly biking adventure:

**1. Helmets for Everyone**

* Make sure every family member has a properly fitting [helmet ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075RRT8RZ?th=1\&psc=1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=a4bc9f6bfc1c762fe6bdf6b799b2e9b9\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)for safety. Looking for a toddler helmet, read [Best Toddler Helmets](https://allaboutmomma.com/Best-Toddler-Helmets-for-1-2-3-and-4-year-olds) to find out my favorites.

**2. Water Bottles**

* Stay hydrated, especially if you’re biking for an extended period. Bring a cycling [water bottle ](https://www.amazon.com/CamelBak-Podium-Chill-White-Black/dp/B07HGRWG1S?crid=252MX4Q2GN25U\&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.nra0aVE6r7IV-a84XeyT3hrrfSu3LXBJFBo1ozqgnKuuhAZeurrUw8CG917ypaRB8FEd9qhlyTNyFnCgF_rIQqVxl-3Nm-oN3G6EIBcgc3CV55ezRzYqBhcHhMFKXGI5LdBjmBpwyJgn1U8Jql-Z_L_s2YQVy6YCbp6pq3tgKX67QV5HpoDVO9nPdZ94xdhO8IRI4isqohSlT9J3h3qODw.5x43qWofJmdc7fv69jRIPLPadxSBT9-4ojKyaIxXx5w\&dib_tag=se\&keywords=cycling%2Bwater%2Bbottle%2Bsis\&qid=1726683291\&refinements=p_123%3A239938\&rnid=85457740011\&s=sporting-goods\&sprefix=cycling%2Bwater%2Bbottle%2Bsis%2Caps%2C113\&sr=1-1\&th=1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=8181a66b16946da3beae0ba40ece7a89\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)for each rider. I sometimes thing I can share with my kids, but they really build up a thirst while riding their bike.

**3. Snacks or Picnic**

* Bring easy-to-eat, energy-boosting snacks like granola bars, fruit, or nuts. If you're planning a longer ride or a stop at a park, pack a picnic.

**4. Weather-Appropriate Clothing**

* Dress in layers if it’s chilly, and bring lightweight, breathable clothing for warmer days. Don’t forget sunscreen, sunglasses, and hats to protect against the sun.

**5. Bike Repair Kit**

* Include a small repair kit with a [tire pump](https://www.amazon.com/Pro-Bike-Tool-Presta-Schrader/dp/B019V1PW5G?crid=1DP5G3YN1DC0\&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.dKnMib_weGrmxTX_ZmJ0wVPRQM9toxDsDLK65y197tjVi7zMRlHVliPpN-4Mqx6zS9LvyuwiVX96HVfWKBFFCQDh7w4PETZgCGMVRBYcH5DSh2XIMcAzP3d3YRhsem7rqTLmjD2eCAgxaZvyWVJIehxZ2IBhSozGBvtM_MEg034UJZx5JpYJ26XCcExUvrA2vrfCcaKgdCVGP6-sACLe-L9ElLMFzfe5E9fohrjlfHT_fvkuWPklLMnCLN7ZQJElgEr_Y8JGo9hKIT1wgt3GMNSXlb6LjWH8D6CbQlRIq6s.uSd2l0-gvx9ZKaUU57OS1BsN8q4S8fuMJ6DNsHs7beo\&dib_tag=se\&keywords=small%2Bbike%2Bpump\&qid=1726683100\&sprefix=small%2Bbike%2Bpump%2Caps%2C93\&sr=8-4-spons\&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY\&th=1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=689548610906526a415607f03c7db393\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl), [patch kit](https://www.amazon.com/Slime-1022-Rubber-Tube-Patch/dp/B003CK75LC?crid=K4XTKHVO4E8G\&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.n74YNJMPHM0qDjpmCW8Kw5rlELRtPqL2Wo8Gb7ZJm_KH30NcJXRYICE2QPqqPcadqgcgsmcIVvmrJksRIZR-r9fttVJHTY-uaGugenF2Q_EH076Ry24RA38W-MJbUaOzmsJPuFp-8euDlqS_0UT5GnHF2tlTXgOY3LvYOqF4ZJMTLd8b2-5XIQkg0iB-XRMhreavSEKfQLjNFzg2syZFBb_-8_PH5HaEW7L9s3gLv9NN8HnJ5Gdhcoo6LYaAsYAws-xasIF1k20_nzgR-j1fAFI_CeL500gCQHKk1EaUXPg.S1ZN2rzAa0EeQZvav8Vy4CNxCEQbk73HlWnfxa2L6QY\&dib_tag=se\&keywords=bike%2Bpatch%2Bkit\&qid=1726683130\&sprefix=bike%2Bpatch%2Bki%2Caps%2C112\&sr=8-5\&th=1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=752c7ef5746608206341fb6b2c933e6a\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl), and a [multi-tool](https://www.amazon.com/Vibrelli-Bike-Multi-Tool-V19/dp/B06XGWMGB9?crid=3M7V5PQLG1WGF\&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.UjWs8iJlWIG1dfIAIa0X30bdT_NqjbkFZNaw_xMIql_765ZWoxyv1_6WHMR1a2_mfXLs1O85kcXDiI5TlpemcCW50NVDR5ic-6vSPziaMe0xNQBzwKX9ciThrGVFTnmS4dLTblRujINstnPCrah7j5PRWG3Dg2gK0Lp-Q0jN8StS0B4fG2VX_UVJl40ttMrytEU-uT-2SU1Ot8b4II0WPbtiF022TO5qylECMH3M81lWY726sbZEe24Vy1T_bnHfEF4PscP4LPFbN9I9LRKy7k9W8XxVu2aSYhu6yVqvGgA.Eu-T02hTBY_8ZRQvD6AN8ZiQeDadPYudDeIQggZ6GR8\&dib_tag=se\&keywords=multi%2Btool%2Bbike\&qid=1726683187\&sprefix=multi%2Btool%2Bbik%2Caps%2C93\&sr=8-7\&th=1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=9668cf8a61287662bee7b2816f7d9973\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) for minor repairs. Flat tires or loose bolts can happen, so it’s good to be prepared and know how to change a tire.

**6. First Aid Kit**

* Pack a [small first aid kit](https://www.amazon.com/First-Pieces-Water-Resistant-Shell-Small/dp/B0C17MKP1S?crid=2OKXHJ59GIDOY\&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ClX2zQjm2pEEyqj_kGaQAYVYqTjISZtQD_cLTUdibcgZF6I1FUUH-PJUe-zI5MfsWOf1i4_Mi-Bckn-Eu4c1GOpmvWbz4kPQsf8QAB0B8VN3zz4OWfpezExWDIeeBiCL1UEqTcwmS61iskseT8-PVgboP9PEBxDwxBWTYTRd0yzmYyeho2_0t2fW44jnMA7t7Sl8XDuDqsfl-O5VT4gvef-TtSBlbKXnCkK-UR4ZyXd8RUCWVQJaQROLPKw51qSpxkAr_nZqiN7mF03areLzkJGN1g8aFfI2f1cMJO7jRao.HhGTsYAQyuwT6Nb4p4KJqP1aHgZg88njwGlVtqMDKIM\&dib_tag=se\&keywords=travel+first+aid+kit\&qid=1726682917\&sprefix=travel+first+aid+kit%2Caps%2C100\&sr=8-7\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=27d9e1dc268ddcee25f0b10189a86453\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) with essentials like band-aids, antiseptic wipes, and any medications you may need.

**8. Bike Locks**

* If you plan on stopping for a break or sightseeing, bring a lock to secure your bikes.

**10.Pannier Bag or Backpack**

* Use a [bike pannier bag](https://www.amazon.com/Rhinowalk-Pannier-Waterproof-Bicycling-Traveling/dp/B09XH7LKM9?crid=1TXD1HHYVEZ0O\&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.I0D5EJCN-PKzvp26u1l1RHJIv7_R8jEHqcJYARzb72YzQZlPYizS6sOW2KA9NlhpzKz1H4O8DLoEKxedACkXGCWcChIDFShw9DIVYA8VnIik-rwIUysthu-WCdG2mdHN37-uCQISfQlccur8yjDffpNFY0h4SMtDpSW-6kG8yVwS8uuCN8WXgfgrCF8BrbCKwsJvgJRwihkHkFmo_Fl5h959z3tyD9aCO7LHZoKO2sFUjnH-Z6SPzL8lW4S4ZuSSlsh2jzGbZwN2dLOhL3yUtPvwiwwY4RnuNvb2WLBUQk0.RIxzMG5Re7UgzbYvf-LA7Ah7w9lsxtuQuLrASdNYBRU\&dib_tag=se\&keywords=pannier%2Bbag\&qid=1726682964\&sprefix=pannier%2Bbag%2Caps%2C99\&sr=8-8\&th=1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=d3ff6ab1d9f643f0631e143c938728eb\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) or a small backpack to carry your essentials. My husband and I both have racks on the back of our bikes to fit on our child carrier seat and pannier bags.

**11. Wet Wipes/Hand Sanitizer**

* For quick clean-ups after a snack or if there are no facilities around.

**12. Lights and Reflectors**

* If you’ll be riding near dusk or in low-light conditions, make sure your bikes have front and rear lights or reflectors for visibility on all bikes.

**13. Comfort Items for Younger Kids**

* If you have younger children riding in a bike trailer or on a bike seat, bring items like a small blanket, extra snacks, or small toys to keep them entertained if riding in a bike trailer. My 2 year old daughter loves to ride on my bike with her baby.

## Top 6 Fall Bike Rides for Families in Bucks County

Delaware Canal Towpath (D\&L Trail)

Difficulty: Easy
Length: Up to 60 miles (choose your section)

![two kids riding and toddler on back bike seat on family bike ride in bucks county pa](http://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1726692317/delaware_canal_fall_family_bike_picture_uvf0hs.jpg)

The Delaware Canal Towpath is an absolute gem in the fall. The path meanders along the **Delaware River**, and with the autumn leaves ablaze in shades of orange, red, and yellow, this mostly flat trail makes it ideal for families with younger children or beginner riders. You can either ride on the PA or NJ side. 

For a fall ride, you could not find a better family spot. As you ride you will get a great view of the river, see leaves falling around you and come across many different charming river towns. Plan a ride to one of the towns or plan a couple mile stretch for the younger riders. You can’t go wrong.

#### Why it's great for families in the fall:

<OutlineBox>
  * Stunning fall foliage and riverside views.
  * Flat, easy terrain makes it perfect for young riders.
  * Ideal for breaks in scenic small towns.
</OutlineBox>

### Best Towns to Visit on A Family Bike Ride on the Delaware Canal Towpath

#### New Hope, PA

New Hope is a vibrant riverside town known for its artistic culture and bustling main street.  It is the most touristy town along the canal. In the fall, this town becomes a postcard-perfect destination with its brightly colored leaves and historic architecture. Riding in from the towpath from either the PA or NJ side has stunning scenery.

I have been riding here since I was a kid and you won’t be disappointed! Families can explore the town’s ice cream and chocolate shops, unique stores, a children’s museum, train station and restaurants, while soaking in the autumn beauty.

This town has a lot of fun things for the kids, but be prepared that it gets very busy on the weekends and there are lots of motorcycle tourists. If you find it too busy head over to **Lambertville, NJ** just across the bridge. That said, I still love coming to this town with my family, but on the weekdays.

**Must-Do**: Stop at a local café for hot cider or a seasonal treat. Plan time for a visit to the Children’s Museum or take a ride on the New Hope Scenic Railroad (the fall foliage excursion).

**Coffee Shops**: Sky Roast Coffee, Starbucks or Dunkin

**Family Friendly Restaurants:** 

* Spatola’s Pizza
* El Guajillo Mexican Restaurant
* The Good Gyro: Mediterranean Restaurant

#### Frenchtown, NJ

Across the river from Bucks County, Frenchtown is a quaint New Jersey town that is full of charm, especially in the fall. Known for its boutique shops, cozy cafés, and artistic vibe, Frenchtown is a great place to stop and take in some local town feels with the family.

![family bike ride bucks county pa with child seat](http://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1726684266/frenchtown_bike_riding_hailey_iy749g.jpg "My Daughter with Frenchtown Bridge behind her")

My family loves cycling here from Tincium Park, a short 2.5 miles with young riders, stopping  for treats or lunch then cycling back. The town is full of options for coffee, food, ice cream and even a candy shop. The book store is always a favorite of my boys.

Must-Do: Grab a bite and explore some of the local shops in town. Bike over the Uhlerstown Frenchtown Bridge.

**Coffee Shops**: Bridge Cafe, Frenchtown Cafe and Perfect Day Cafe

**Family Friendly Restaurants:**

* Honey Moon Bakery & Pizzeria
* Cocina Del Sol- Mexican

#### Milford, NJ

Milford is another charming New Jersey town that cyclists can easily reach from the Delaware Canal Towpath. Milford has a more laid-back, small-town feel, with tree-lined streets, cozy eateries, and a historic downtown area. 

I love visiting Milford with my family because it is way less touristy and more manageable with small kids.

**Must-Do**: Enjoy a riverside picnic or grab some comfort food at a local diner after your ride.

**Coffee Shops:** On the PA side across from Milford is Homestead Coffee Roasters, a great family place for treats and the adults to fuel up.

**Family Friendly Restaurants:**

* El Charro Del Rio: Mexican 
* Pipolo’s Pizza
* Panda House
* Descendants Brewing Company: Brewpub

#### Lumberville, PA

Tucked between New Hope and Frenchtown, Lumberville is a tiny, picturesque village known for its rustic charm and beautiful river views. It is one of my family's favorite spots!

The Lumberville-Raven Rock Bridge provides a scenic crossing over the Delaware River, where you can walk your bike and enjoy the stunning autumn landscape. Your family can have a foot in both PA and NJ while standing on the bridge!

**Must-Do**: Pause for photos on the bridge, and head over to NJ where a playground awaits. Also indulge in lunch or a snack at the Lumberville General Store, a very family friendly spot with eating outside and inside.

**Coffee Shops:** Lumberville General Store offers coffee

**Family Friendly Restaurants:** Black Bass has a lovely balcony over the Delaware, but best with families with older kids. For younger kids I suggest[ Lumberville General Store,](https://www.thelumbervillegeneralstore.com/) it has delicious food and plenty of space for the kids to run around.

#### Yardley, PA

Yardley is a peaceful, family-friendly town located along the towpath. With its tree-lined streets and small-town charm, Yardley offers the perfect quiet respite from your ride. The town’s riverfront park is especially beautiful in the fall, making it a great place to relax and take in the seasonal colors. Yardley is also home to several cozy cafés and shops, perfect for a quick break.

I have a soft spot for this D\&L Town as I grew up in Yardley and, after getting married, my husband and I lived there for a year. It has some great family friendly eating spots and some nice tasty treats for a hot day!

**Must-Do:** Enjoy a cup of coffee, a pastry or stay for lunch

**Coffee Shops:** Pretty Bird Coffee Roasters or Starbucks

**Family Friendly Restaurants:**

* Cramer's Bakery always has something delicious for everyone ( I use to get my birthday cakes from there
* Yardley Ice House: Yummy 
* Continental Tavern: Sit down food, has a lovely porch to sit outside on nice days
* Yardley Pizza: Kid Friendly option

#### Washington Crossing, PA

Famous for its historical significance, Washington Crossing is a must-stop for history lovers and fall enthusiasts alike. The town’s Washington Crossing Historic Park offers gorgeous autumn scenery and a chance to learn about George Washington’s historic crossing of the Delaware River. In fall, the park’s rich history is beautifully complemented by the vibrant foliage. This stop is great in history but lacks kid friendly eateries and a playpark. 

**Must-Do:** Tour the historic sites or take a peaceful walk through the park’s wooded trails.

**Coffee Shops:** No

**Family Friendly Restaurants: **Washington Crossing Inn, but not the best family food option as it is more upscale
