## Why Do You Need a Toddler Travel Bed?

This is the golden question and the answer will help you to understand which travel toddler bed is best for you and your family. There are many considerations in selecting a travel bed.  Probably the two most important considerations are; 

1. what **type of travel** are you planning, (international or domestic)

3. which method of traveling, (**car or plane**) will you be doing.

If you are traveling by plane check out **[Tips For Flying With Toddlers](/tips-for-flying-with-toddlers)**.

### Toddler Travel Bed Considerations for International Travel

International travel requires more consideration. One popular type of traveling toddler bed is an **inflatable bed**, which usually comes with an **electric pump.** The pump may not work outside of the country in which you purchased the pump.  

For example, if you are like me and live in the United States, that electric pump would not work on a trip to England. When visiting the in-laws a US electric pump would not work without an outlet converter.

If you are flying internationally the **size and weight of the bed** are more important. The concept of free hold luggage on flights has all but disappeared and now you must pay for the privilege. The smaller you can compact your luggage and the lighter the weight the better.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975388/cousin-visit-need-travel-toddler-bed.jpg "Picture of my two kids with their two cousins on a family vacation to New Hampshire, we definitely needed to bring portable toddler beds!")

### Portable Toddler Travel Bed Considerations for Road Trips

If you foresee most of your travel via road trips an inflatable bed could work. However, **size will still be a consideration** as you don’t want the toddler bed to take up half the trunk! Or you want to consider how easy setting up the toddler bed will be, personally I don’t want to spend 10 minutes struggling to blow up a bed!

Are you going to be using this **bed to camp**? If you plan to **[hike with your toddler](/equipment-needed-to-hike-with-your-toddler)** you might not have easy access to an electrical outlet to connect a pump for an inflatable bed. 

Some people consider using a portable bed at a grandparent’s house, and might leave the portable bed there to be stored. This gives you the **most flexibility** as you will not be carting the bed back and forth. 

Personally, I wanted a bed that I could use in all different types of situations for my two toddlers. We have family abroad, I foresee us hiking with the boys, and I like to have a portable option for when we stay at friends' houses and family vacations.

I wanted just **one travel bed** to fit all my variable needs.

## Benefits of a Toddler Travel Bed

If your child sleeps in a toddler bed then you will want a portable bed for them when away from home.  Your toddler is used to sleeping on their own and while away giving him/her their own bed will not only help them **sleep better but make your life easie**r! 

Some parents choose to **co-sleep** with their toddlers outside of their home, but personally I don't sleep as well with my toddler.  Have you seen how toddlers sleep? Toddlers often end up sleeping horizontally across the bed, and there is always the worry that they would fall out of an adult size bed.

Another major benefit to toddlers having their own sleep space is that toddlers tend to have earlier bedtimes than adults. My 3 year old’s and 16 month old's bedtime is between 7 and 7:30 p.m. After I put them to sleep my husband and I have **childfree time**.

I value child free time and even more so on vacation.  Providing your toddler their own space to sleep frees the parents up to do as they please while your toddler sleeps.

## When a Pack-n-play Doesn’t Work Anymore

A Pack-n-play is the universal travel crib for babies. They work great for **[road trips wth a baby](/tips-for-road-trip-with-a-baby)**. There are other travel crib products out there but by far the most common is the pack-n-play.

Hotels and Airbnbs often have one available upon request. However, Pack-n-Plays have the feel of a crib and once your toddler is no longer in a crib at home he/she most likely will not be happy going back to one.

If your little one is still in a crib you can read **[Best Baby Travel Cribs](/best-travel-crib)**.

The height limit of Pack-n-Plays are **35 inches** which a toddler will outgrow between the ages of 2-3.  The weight limit is around **30 lbs,** depending on the brand. Your toddler is quickly going to feel cramped in a Pack-n-play and sooner or later you will need to change your portable sleeping arrangements.

## What To Look For In A Travel Toddler Bed

1. **Size:** Travel Beds come in all different sizes. If your toddler is on the tall size you will want to make sure he/she won't outgrow the travel bed too quickly. Some companies have a larger version, such as **[Regalo My Cot Extra Long](https://www.amazon.com/Regalo-Extra-Portable-Fitted-Travel/dp/B00BIETAJ4?crid=3EY4YLT322A01&keywords=regalo+my+cot+large+size&qid=1675716691&s=baby-products&sprefix=regalo+my+cot+large+size%2Cbaby-products%2C87&sr=1-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=32a17117cf2a64c74bafc723876da44f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)**.

3. **Type of Bed**: Travel Beds come in a cot style, blowup or ground mat. Blowup travel bed require a pump, which are commonly sold with the bed.

5. **Weight**: Best travel beds are lightweight. Who likes lugging around heavy equipment?

7. **Compact Dimensions**: If planning on taking on a plane you will need a bed to fit in your suitcase

9. **Safety:** A toddler bed shouldn't have been recalled! Also the bed should pass all safety requirements

11. **Set Up Time** **and Ease:** Travel Cots are quick and easy to set-up. Blowup beds take more time and effort.

## What Travel Bed is Best for a 2 Year Old, a Blowup Bed or Cot?

Many newly 2 year olds have not traditional to a traditional bed at home. If you have not transitioned your 2 year old yet a cot might not work. A cot doesn't come with sides and could be confusing for a crib sleeper.

Some blowup beds come with bumpers, such as the [**Hiccapop Inflatable Toddler Bed**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LWQMM4V?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=ba83d1268809b1721d46a20a7a4d4d61&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl). This bed will be easier for a crib sleeping toddler to use on trips. Only downside is that an inflatable bed takes longer to set up and take down.

A 2 year old who is used to a normal bed can either sleep in a cot or inflatable bed. Parent's choice.

## What Type of Travel Bed is Best for a 3 Year Old?

A cot is a great choice for a 3 year old. At this age your toddler should have transitioned away from the crib into a normal bed. Your toddler will know how to sleep in a cot and I love the quick set up of this option.

## Tips For Successfully Using A Toddler Travel Bed

- Let your toddler help pick out travel bed colors or design (if applicable)

- Try the travel bed at home first.

- When away create same sleeping atmosphere away as at home. Think bedtime routine and sound machines

- Bring a blanket your toddler is used to sleeping with

- Don't forget the **[toddler travel pillow](https://www.amazon.com/Toddler-Pillow-Pillowcase-Sleeping-Hypoallergenic/dp/B077MB5SZG?crid=8SHXY9WZTGOG&keywords=toddler%2Btravel%2Bpillow&qid=1675721227&s=baby-products&sprefix=toddler%2Btravel%2Bpillow%2Cbaby-products%2C88&sr=1-6&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=1900c380ba8c08ed4989b16bdd280773&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)**!
