## What Style of Helmet is Safest for Toddlers?

When it comes to choosing a style of helmet for toddlers, the safest option is a multi-purpose helmet specifically designed for biking or skateboarding, depending on your child's interest. If your toddler scooters, bikes and skates you might do best with an all purpose helmet instead of a specific bike helmet.

Look for helmets that meet safety standards, which ensures they have undergone rigorous testing to provide adequate impact protection. 

Additionally, helmets with MIPS (Multi-Directional Impact Protection System) technology offer an extra layer of safety by reducing rotational forces during an impact. 

Lucky for us there are plenty of styling toddler helmets that are safe!

## What Does MIPS Technology Mean in a Toddlers Helmet?

MIPS stands for Multi-Directional Impact Protection System. It is a technology integrated into certain helmets, primarily bike helmets, to provide an additional layer of protection against rotational forces during an impact. Rotational forces can occur during an angled impact, causing the head to rotate rapidly, potentially leading to brain injuries.

MIPS technology works by incorporating a low-friction layer inside the helmet. This layer allows the helmet to slide slightly relative to the head upon impact, mimicking the brain's own natural protection system. By reducing the rotational forces transmitted to the brain, MIPS technology aims to decrease the risk of brain injuries, such as concussions.

Helmets with MIPS technology are designed to provide enhanced safety for users by addressing the specific risks associated with rotational impacts. It is important to note that while MIPS can offer additional protection, it is still essential to ensure a proper fit and follow standard safety guidelines when using any helmet.

## What to Look For When Buying a Toddler Helmet?

![three toddler bike helmets](http://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1689803867/bike_helmets_for_toddlers_3_hdcftd.jpg)

### Proper Fit of Helmet

* The helmet should fit securely and snugly on your toddler's head without any wobbling or sliding. Look for helmets with adjustable sizing systems or fit dials to customize the fit as your child grows.

### Safety Certifications

* Check for certifications like CPSC (Consumer Product Safety Commission) in the United States, which ensures the helmet meets safety standards for bike helmets and ASTM F1492 for skate helmets. 
* Look for labels or stickers indicating compliance with recognized safety standards.

### Size and Age Range

* Make sure the helmet is appropriate for your child's age and head size. Manufacturers often provide age and head circumference guidelines to help you select the right size.

### Coverage and Protection

* Opt for helmets that provide ample coverage, including protection for the back of the head. Look for extended coverage and helmets designed specifically for the activity.

### Ventilation

* Ensure the helmet has adequate ventilation to keep your toddler's head cool and comfortable during rides. Look for helmets with multiple vents or ventilation channels.

### Adjustable Straps and Buckles

* Check for easily adjustable straps and buckles that secure the helmet in place. They should be easy to use and provide a secure and comfortable fit.

### Padding and Comfort

* Look for helmets with sufficient padding inside for cushioning and comfort. The padding should be removable and washable for hygiene purposes.

### Increased Visibility

* Consider helmets with reflective elements or bright colors to enhance visibility, especially when riding in low-light conditions.

### Weight of Toddler Helmet

* Choose a lightweight helmet that won't strain your toddler's neck and make it uncomfortable to wear for extended periods.

### Style and Design of Toddler Helmet

* While safety is paramount, finding a helmet with a design or style that your toddler likes can make wearing it more appealing and increase compliance.
* Remember, it's crucial to regularly inspect and replace a helmet if it has been involved in a significant impact or shows signs of damage.

## What Size Helmet is Best for a 1 or 2 Year Old?

When choosing a helmet size for a 1 or 2-year-old, it's essential to consider their head circumference. The circumference of a child's head is the primary factor in determining the appropriate helmet size. 

* Extra Small (XS): Typically fits head circumferences ranging from 44cm to 48cm (17.25 inches to 18.75 inches). This size is suitable for many 1-year-olds and some smaller 2-year-olds.
* Small (S): Generally fits head circumferences ranging from 48cm to 52cm (18.75 inches to 20.5 inches). This size is suitable for most 2-year-olds and some larger 1-year-olds.

However, it's crucial to note that head sizes can vary among children, so it's best to measure your child's head circumference before purchasing a helmet. 

When trying on helmets, ensure a snug and secure fit without any excessive movement or gaps. The helmet should sit level on their head, covering the forehead, and the chin strap should be adjusted to keep the helmet in place.

## How To Measure Your Toddler Head Circumference

To measure their head circumference, use a flexible measuring tape and wrap it around the widest part of their head, just above the eyebrows. 

Read the number where the measuring tape meets. This is their current head circumference. Verify every 6 months to be safe.

**Pro Tip**: My toddlers always get their head circumference measured at the doctors during their check ups. If your toddler has recently had a check up you can use that for reference.

## What is the Best Helmet Shape for a Toddler?

The best helmet shape for a toddler is one that provides full coverage and protection for the head, particularly the forehead and the back of the head. The key features to consider for an optimal helmet shape are:

* 1\. Round Shape: Look for helmets with a rounded shape that conforms to the natural contours of a toddler's head. This helps ensure a secure and comfortable fit.
* 2\. Extended Coverage: Choose a helmet with extended coverage at the back to provide additional protection for the occipital bone and the back of the head. This is especially important for toddlers who are still developing their balance and coordination skills.
* 3\. Full Head Coverage: The helmet should cover the entire top of the head, including the forehead, without exposing any vulnerable areas.
* 4\. Lowered Temple Coverage: Opt for a helmet with slightly lowered temple coverage to protect the sides of the head. This can be particularly beneficial for toddlers who may have a tendency to **fall or lean to the side and skateboarding helmets**.
* 5\. Rounded Edges: Helmets with rounded edges are generally more comfortable and reduce the risk of sharp edges digging into the toddler's skin.

Additionally you want to consider the primary reason for the helmet.

**Pro Tip:** If you are cycling with your toddler in a bike seat you will want a toddler bike helmet with a flat back. A flat back helmet will rub less against the seat resulting in the helmet staying in place and not getting pushed forward.

## What is the Difference Between a Toddler Skating Helmet and a Toddler Bike Helmet?

![my son in a bike helmet vs my other son in a skate helmet](http://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1689802987/bike_helmet_vs_skate_helmet_zy5wwu.jpg "Left: Skate helmet vs Right: bike helmet")

Skate helmets and bike helmets for toddlers differ in their design and features to cater to the specific needs of each activity. Here are the key differences between skate helmets and bike helmets for toddlers:

### Skate Helmets Weigh and Cover More

* Skate helmets typically offer more coverage compared to bike helmets. They have a rounder and deeper shape, providing protection to a larger portion of the head, including the back and sides.
* This is because skateboarding poses a higher risk of falls and impacts from multiple directions.This results in a toddler skate helmet weighing more.

### Skate Helmets are Designed for Multiple Impacts while Bike Helmets Designed for Only One

* Skate helmets are designed to withstand multiple impacts and offer higher impact protection. They often have a hard outer shell made of ABS plastic or a similar material, combined with an inner foam liner to absorb and distribute impact energy.
* Bike helmets are generally designed for single-impact protection and focus on absorbing the force of one major impact.

### Bike Helmets Offer More Ventilation and Keeps Heads Cooler

* Bike helmets typically have more ventilation with larger vents to promote airflow and keep the head cool during cycling. 
* Skate helmets, on the other hand, may have fewer and smaller vents, as skateboarding involves less intense physical exertion and typically takes place in shorter bursts.

### Skate Helmets Typically Are More Adjustable and Customizable

* Skate helmets often have a more adjustable fit system, including adjustable straps and sometimes an additional padding kit for customization. This allows for a snug and secure fit, which is important for the helmet to stay in place during skateboarding tricks and maneuvers. 
* Bike helmets, while still adjustable, may have a simpler fit system as the focus is primarily on comfort and stability during cycling.

### Skate Helmets and Bike Helmets have Different Safety Certifications

* Skate helmets may comply with ASTM F1492, which is specific to skateboarding and trick roller skating
* Bike helmets comply with CPSC (Consumer Product Safety Commission) certification for cycling safety.

When choosing a helmet for your toddler, consider the specific activity they will be engaged in, whether it's skateboarding, biking, or both.

## How Often Should a Toddler Helmet be Replaced?

Toddlers grow quickly, and their helmet needs may change as they develop. In addition, helmets can experience wear and tear over time, potentially impacting their effectiveness. Therefore, it is generally recommended to replace a toddler's helmet in the following situations:

### Growth of your Toddler's Head

* As your toddler grows, their head size may change, requiring a larger helmet. 
* If the helmet becomes too small or does not fit correctly, it's time to replace it with a larger size.

My personal experience was a helmet sized for my 1 year old fit for a year and a half before I had to size up. However, a 3 year old helmet will last longer. Remember the younger the toddler the quicker their head will be growing.

### Significant Impact from a Crash or Fall

* If the helmet has been involved in a significant impact or accident, it should be replaced, even if there are no visible signs of damage. 
* Helmets are designed to absorb impact and protect against a single event. 
* After a crash, the structural integrity of the helmet may be compromised, making it less effective in subsequent impacts.

### Damage and Wear

* Regularly inspect the helmet for any signs of damage, such as cracks, dents, or frayed straps. 
* If you notice any significant damage or wear, it is advisable to replace the helmet, as it may not provide the same level of protection as a new one.

### Helmet Age and Usage

* Manufacturers typically recommend replacing helmets every three to five years, even if there are no visible signs of damage. 
* Over time, the materials may degrade or become less effective at absorbing impacts.

As a mom that means not reusing helmets, once one child outgrows a helmet I dispose of it.

Remember, the safety of your toddler is paramount, and a well-fitting and undamaged helmet is crucial for protecting their head during activities. 

## The Best Toddler Skate Helmets for Boys and Girls

Choosing the best toddler skate helmet depends on several factors, including fit, safety features, comfort, and personal preference. A toddler skate helmet weighs more than a toddler bike helmet due to a larger protection area and designed for multiple impacts.

Skate Helmets are great for toddlers who skateboard, rollerblade, or scooter.

* The S-ONE Lifer CPSC helmet is a popular choice among skateboarders of all ages, including toddlers. It is made with a high-density EPS foam liner that provides excellent multi impact protection. The helmet is dual-certified CPSC and ASTM, has a snug fit, and comes in various vibrant colors.
* Sizes range from x-small (18.5 cm) to large (20.5 cm) before moving up to the S-One Lifer Helmet for more kid sizes.
* The big drawback is it is the heaviest skate helmet.For this reason, I would recommend it for an older toddler of 3 or 4.

Remember, when choosing a skate helmet for your toddler, it's crucial to ensure the proper fit by following the manufacturer's size guidelines and adjusting the straps accordingly. Additionally, always prioritize safety certifications to ensure the helmet meets the necessary standards for impact protection.

* The Ouwoer Kids Bike helmet in size small (48-54cm) fits most toddlers as young as one at one of the more affordable prices. My middle child had a large head and this helmet initially fit him great. It comes with sets of pads to further fit the helmet to your toddlers head.
* This helmet was made for multi sports with its EPS thick foam providing shock-absorbency. 
* Satisfies the safety requirements and comes in many solid colors; I have blue and orange. 
* The one downside of this helmet I found is if your child has a more long or oval shaped head the fit isn’t great. One of my children has an elongated egg shaped head and this helmet doesn’t fit great. For my other two children with more rounded heads I have no concern.

Often a 1 year old’s head circumference is too small to fit most toddler bike helmets, unless your 1 year old is in the top percentile for head circumference. Both my boys were, however my daughter was not.

* 259 grams
* The Giro Hale MIPS Helmet satisfies all toddler safety requirements 
* Features MIPS technology, which provides additional protection against rotational forces, this helmet offers an extra layer of safety for your little one
* Its super lightweight construction, comfortable fit, and a wide range of vibrant colors and patterns make it a popular choice for 2, 3 and 4 year olds
* My only downside is that it comes in a standard buckle. You do have to watch not to pinch your toddler when securing the helmet, however that does make it more affordable.

This is a great toddler helmet for 2, 3 and 4 year olds. My son, aged 3, wears this helmets and the fit is exceptional.He has an elongated head, and most helmets don’t fit his head well. This helmet supports his less rounded head shape and keeps him safe. **I highly recommend this helmet for toddlers with more egg shaped heads.**
