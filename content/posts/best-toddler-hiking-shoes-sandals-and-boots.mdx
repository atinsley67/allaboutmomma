There is nothing like letting your toddler loose on the trails and watching them enjoy themselves.  Maybe they completed their first mini mountain hike or you're sticking to the flat, there is nothing more special than **[hiking with your toddle](/hiking-with-toddlers-ultimate-guide)**r. 

![toddler hiking sandals best with water](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975427/hiking-with-cousins-small-version.jpg "My two hiking in hiking sandals and their cousin in hiking shoes")

But do they need toddler hiking shoes? The answer is mixed and I found through my 3 kids that certain shoes, sandals and boots make sense for hiking with toddlers. 

Before deciding on the perfect hiking shoe for your toddler there are a couple things you will want to consider. Also check out **[Toddler Hiking Gear](/equipment-needed-to-hike-with-your-toddler)** for more information on gear for hiking with a toddler.

## **Do Toddlers Need Specific Hiking Shoes?**

No, they don’t need it, but it might be smart to have your toddler wear shoes with certain features to help with hiking.

When you hike often with a toddler you notice that trails are rough, your toddler likes to climb on the rocks, go in the water on a hot day and jump on the tree stumps. If you wear their everyday sneakers on hikes the sneaker won’t last very long and it will become VERY dirty quickly.

For families that hike often, owning a pair of toddler hiking shoes is logical. It means you won’t ruin all their other shoes!

A toddler is new to walking and when walking on all different types of terrain you want a shoe that protects their developing feet and provides the right level of traction. 

## **Difference Between Toddler Hiking Shoe, Sandal and Boot**

Depending on the type of hike and the weather you may wonder what type of toddler hiking footwear is best. 

A **toddler hiking shoe** is designed like an athletic shoe but has additional features to help holdup on the trail. A hiking shoe will have low ankles, fitting like a normal shoe. 

A **toddler hiking sandal** is designed to be lightweight and dry quickly. Your toddler will be able to wade in the creek and stream beds while protecting their feet. They are made to get wet.

**Toddler hiking boots** is similar to a hiking shoe but provides **more ankle support**. Hiking boots are heavier and sturdier. This is a great option for any toddler who has hurt their ankles or needs additional support.

## **What to Look for in Toddler Hiking Shoes**

![toddler hiking shoes great protection](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975427/oshkosh-toddler-hiking-shoe.jpg "My almost 2 year old in his hiking shoes and hiking pants")

### Durability:

Toddlers play rough. You want a hiking shoe that can uphold the abuse it will get. Shoes made with leather/rubber soles are a great sign.

### Comfort:

If the shoe is not comfortable on your toddlers feet they will have no problem taking them off, no matter where you are

### Flexible:

A new walker needs to strengthen the muscles in their feet. The best way to do this is to wear a shoe that is flexible and does not inhibit motion.

### Lightweight & Breathable:

Children’s feet sweat 2-3 times more than adult feet. A breathable lightweight shoe helps prevent your toddlers feet from overheating. 

### Great Traction:

A hiking toddler is going to be rock scrambling, jumping off logs and running down hills; to prevent falling you want a shoe with great traction. No slips please.

### Support:

Hiking trails are not free from sharp objects, but a hiking shoe will protect your toddler’s arch from it!

The shoe is durable, provides great toe protection and is somewhat flexible. It is machine washable and comfortable to wear.

Compared to the Merrel Trail Chaser and Keen Chandler the OshKosh shoe is less breathable and there is less traction on the sole. For a new hiker who won’t yet climb on the boulders or jump off the tree stumps this is a great affordable hiking shoe.

The hiking shoe has a rubber anti slip sole, anti collision toe bump and breathable mesh. 

I do notice the quality lags behind the other brands, but a great hiking shoe option for those toddlers who only hike occasionally. 

## **Best Toddler Hiking Sandals**

\[table id=20 /\]

A toddler hiking sandal is primarily used in warm weather. The benefits of a sandal is complete breathability and opens up water play options. 

![hiking with toddlers hiking sandals](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975429/hike-with-toddlers-water-hikes.jpg "Toddler Hiking Sandals are perfect for jumping into creeks")

My toddler primarily wears toddler hiking sandals in the summer and I love it. The hiking sandals spend a lot of time in streams and in creek beds and when we hit the trail again, quickly dry out before getting in the car to go home. I don’t have to worry about wet socks or pruney feet.

### _What to Look for in Toddler Hiking Sandals_

You will want to look for everything that was important in a toddler hiking shoe, but also

### Drying Time:

A great toddler hiking sandal will dry quickly on a toddlers feet

### Closure:

A sandal should stay securely on a toddler’s feet, a slip on will NOT work. For a hiking sandal to work the sandal should go around your toddler's ankle and have a way to tighten.

It is quick-drying, flexible, lightweight and protects the toes. Great for a toddler who won’t wear them everyday.

The one thing to note is the velcro closure can wear out quicker than other brands. I tried these sandals one summer and they worked great for 2 months. By the third month and being used every day the velcro frayed.

Only going hiking a couple times in the summer and want a toddler hiking sandal that can withstand water play? **[Apakowa toddler sandal](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083446RQB?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=0dff165f7e34c688dbcffd633cff119e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** is a great budget friendly option.

With my first child I used this toddler sandal for hiking to start and wasn’t disappointed for the price. It only lasted one kid and by the end of summer was a little worse for wear, but got used everyday for 3 months. 

However, if you are looking for a hiking sandal to survive more than one child, the Keen Newport H2 Sandal is what I would recommend. I do notice a difference in quality.

## **Best Toddler Hiking Boots**

\[table id=21 /\]

Toddler Hiking boots are best for toddlers who require extra ankle support when hiking. Or your toddler might like hiking boots over hiking shoes just because mommy and daddy wear a hiking boot. 

### _What to Look for in a Toddler Hiking Boots_

Toddler hiking boots are going to be very similar to a hiking shoe except for added support particularly around the ankles. They will be heavier than a shoe, but still should be breathable and flexible.

Typically a young walker doesn’t require the extra ankle stability and often manufacturers only start making a toddler hiking boot at larger sizes (around 8T and above). 

A hiking boot is more common in colder weather, however in snow I recommend toddler snow boots, not hiking boots. For snow a snow boot will be designed to keep your toddlers feet warmer and dryer than a toddler hiking boot.

## **Final Thoughts on Toddler Hiking Shoes**

Specific Toddler Hiking Shoes are **not required** to go hiking with your kids. For casual hiking an athletic sneaker will be appropriate.

 If you plan on hiking often a toddler hiking shoe makes sense. You don’t want to ruin your nice shoes, wear them out or get them filthy. A **hiking shoe is designed to take the extra abuse** your toddler will no doubt dish out.

![toddler hiking shoes best for rocks: Keen](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975431/toddler-on-rocks-keen-shoes.jpg "Impossible keeping this toddler off the rocks!")

A toddler hiking shoe provides **better traction for your toddler while rock climbing, tree hopping and trail scrambling**. It will protect your toddler’s toes but yet be lightweight and breathable.

As your toddler gets older and hikes more, a toddler hiking shoe is worth the cost. And they look adorable when on!

**Pro Tip: When hiking with a toddler and wearing toddler hiking shoes or boots always pack an extra pair of socks! Nothing is worse than unexpected cold, wet feet.**
