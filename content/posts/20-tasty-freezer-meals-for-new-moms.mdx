Arrival of your baby coming soon? Starting to plan what you can make ahead of time to make postpartum easier? I am currently 33 weeks pregnant with my third child and looking to start prepping my freezer meals.

I have chosen to do meal prep before each of my babies' arrival and very thankful I did. One of the last things you want to do when you are sleep deprived it slave over a kitchen. But you still always craved good food. Freezer meals are the way to go!
