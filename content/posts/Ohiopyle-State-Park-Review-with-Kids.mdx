Ohiopyle State Park is the southern gateway into the Laurel Highlands and located in south western Pennsylvania. The park is one of the largest state parks in Pennsylvania and well known for its white water rafting. Small kids aren’t going to be kayaking down the river yet, but have no fear there are plenty of other attractions for families I will take you through!![Ohiopyle state park pa with two kids exploring the rocks](http://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1724803418/ohiopyle_main_river_rocks_photo_kmaqol.jpg "Rocks on Youghiogheny River")

My three kids, mom and myself enjoyed a great week here staying in the campground’s yurts. The park has so many family friendly attractions that it is hard not to enjoy yourself. Whether your family enjoys hiking, biking, history or low key fun this park won’t disappoint.

I found out about this park when I read “50 Adventures in the 50 States”. I have lived in PA most my life, but had never heard of Ohiopyle and the natural waterslides this book highlighted. A picture of people riding the rock slides that naturally formed seemed too idyllic to be true. Immediately, I put this state park adventure on my radar and sure enough was able to spend a week there.

Not only does this park offer this unique experience, but also the Great Allegheny Passage way runs through town. The Great Allegheny Passage is a bike and hike trail that starts in Pittsburgh and continues, changing names to C\&O canal, to Washington DC. The path follows the river and goes through many charming towns.

## Where to Stay at Ohiopyle State Park

[Ohiopyle State Park ](https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateParks/FindAPark/OhiopyleStatePark/Pages/default.aspx)offers many different options for staying the night, aout 200 options. Kentuck campground is located a short distance from downtown Ohiopyle town and offers full hook up and basic spots for RV and tent camping as well as yurts and rustic cabins. There are also 27 walk to sites that require you to walk a short distance from your car to camp at.

When I say rustic cabins I mean rustic. These cabins, unlike cabins at [Worlds’ End](https://allaboutmomma.com/Worlds-End-State-Park-Family-Review) and [Ricketts Glen](https://allaboutmomma.com/Ricketts-Glen-State-Park-Review-with-Kids) State Park, do not have small kitchens. The rustic cabins only have beds and a shelter from the outdoors.

The campground features a playground, where my kids enjoyed making friends everyday, and shower houses. The shower houses were cleaned daily and a large washing station was inside. Other parks have washing stations outside the shower houses.

Pets are allowed on some campsites, but not in the yurts where we were staying. You had to book ahead and book for a site where pets were allowed.

## My Yurt Experience at Ohiopyle State Park with Kids

![yurts at Kentuck campground at Ohiopyle State Park](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1724803410/kentuck_camping_ground_yurts_obbvqm.jpg "Our firepit and grill ")

I stayed in a yurt with my kids and mother and it worked out great! Ohiopyle state park didn’t have my favorite yurt, that would be Tuscarora State Park, but it worked great. It had two sets of bunk beds, with railings for the top bunk. This is a nice feature, it allows my younger kids to sleep up top without me worrying that they will fall in the night. With the kids up top I can sleep down on the bottom, which as I am an adult I am happy not to have to climb to the top bunk.

The yurt had a fridge, stove, microwave, pantry space and a kitchen table with 3 chairs. Some state parks have a larger or smaller table and this one was decent size, just wish I had the fourth chair.

The yurt has heating but no air conditioning. For us this was okay, we went on a colder than normal week for August and ended up using the heat at night. The yurt does have two fans which really help circulate the air when it is hot inside. 

The yurts all come with a firepit with a grill and a picnic table. The picnic table wasn’t as clean as other parks, mostly due to paint being on it. We lucked out by remembering a table cloth which instantly made our outdoor picnic table nice.

The yurt also had a small porch, which is uncovered. 

All the yurts were close to, if not next, to the playground, yurt 4 is adjacent to it. The kids could easily and safely walk to the park to play when I was cooking dinner or they had some down time. It was also the main place my kids made friends on the trip!

## Packing for Ohiopyle State Park with Kids

### Lodging

This will depend on what type of camping you are planning to do; tent camping, bringing your RV or staying in the park yurts or rustic cabins. 

### Yurts

None of the yurts are stocked with linens or cookware so you will need to plan all the basics.

### Rustic Cabins:

The rustic cabins only have bunk beds so you will need to bring your own linens. In terms of cooking you will need to cook your food on the fire grill, bring a camping stove or eat out.

### Hiking Gear

Hiking is a must do at Ohiopyle State Park and there are trails you can access right from the Kentuck campground. There are also lots of other trails you can drive to or bike to! [Hiking with toddlers](https://allaboutmomma.com/equipment-needed-to-hike-with-your-toddler) or a [baby](https://allaboutmomma.com/hiking-with-you-baby-0-6-months) is doable with the right gear!

Ohiopyle State Park has several water play opportunities if the weather is hot enough. You will want to make sure you pack a bathing suit, water sandals for your kids and yourself and a towel to dry off.

### Bike Gear

Ohiopyle State Park has the Great Allegheny Trail which is a must do if you are traveling to this park. This pedestrian path is great for cycling and nestled next to the creek the whole way. Except for the town of Ohiopyle this path is not next to any roads and it makes the perfect cycling road for kids and families.

## What To Do At Ohiopyle State Park with Kids

The top things to do with kids are:

1. Ride the Natural Waterslides at Meadow Run Slides
2. Hike around Cucumber Falls
3. Rock Hop Youghinoghemy River by Ferncliff Trail
4. Bike the Great Allegheny Passage
5. Picnic at Tharp Knob Overlook
6. Enjoy the view at Baughman Rock Overlook
7. Check out Ohiopyle State Park Office
8. Hike McCune Trail
9. Enjoy Ohiopyle town with ice cream and park play
10. Attend a free Ranger Program 
11. Make friends at Kentuck Campground Playground

### Ride the Natural Waterslides 

Ohiopyle is famous for its natural waterslides at Meadow Run. My boys 4 and 5 had no problem hopping in the stream and riding their way down. The water is brisk, so pick the hottest day for this activity.

![ohiopyle state park meadow run natural waterslides](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1724803366/natural_waterslides_charlie_bf4rtd.jpg "My 4 Year Old Riding the Slides")

The waterslides were pretty safe coming from a mom of 3. I hear if there was a lot of rain the waterslides could be more dangerous for younger kids. When we went there hadn’t been too much rain so the slides were tame. There are a couple deeper sections the slides let out onto, but nothing taller than my 4 year old. 

I also took the ride down the slides and enjoyed the unique experience. However, I won’t lie; I had a couple light bruises on my butt the next day.

Parking fills up quickly, so make sure to come early or be prepared to wait some time for a spot to open up.

### Hike around Cucumber Falls

This was my boys’ favorite time while staying at Ohiopyle State Park, we had to go back before going home. The waterfall isn’t the most dramatic, but it is a nice long drop and the area is covered in large rocks making the perfect nature playground for kids.

![Cucumber falls in ohiopyle state park things to do with kids](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1724803322/cucumber_falls_boys_waterfall_au871v.jpg "My two boys standing in front of the falls")

My boys would have spent hours climbing over rocks, making dams out of the streams, using fallen trees as balance beams and finding their way to the Youghinogheny River and behind the waterfall. 

You will want to make sure everyone is in water sandals because if your family is like mine your kids are going to explore every water feature around.

If you follow the rocks, or easier trail, to the right to the River you will find my favorite spot. There are a couple large rocks you can sit at and watch the kayaks go by. It is also a great water play area for kids, a little natural beach.

### Rock Hop Youghinoghemy River by Ferncliff Trail

The Ferncliff trail can be found across the Ohiopyle bridge to the peninsula side. This trail is a loop and takes you around the whole of the peninsula with plenty of opportunities for rock hopping and playing by the river.

![youghiogheny river at ohiopyle state park things to do with kids](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1724803349/ohiopyle_main_river_bank_scenic_shot_pvyapz.jpg "My kids exploring the river area")

On the rocks you will get a nice view of Ohiopyle Waterfall across from the State Park Office. If you are lucky you might get to see a kayaker take the risk and go down the waterfall, which we did. Most people start kayaking below the falls.

After going along the river and chances to rock hop the trail winds inland for a more forested walk. You can still see the river below, but not access it. The whole loop is 1.7 miles. You have the option to take Fernwood Trail to shorten the hike if you desire.

### Bike the Great Allegheny Trail

The Great Allegheny Trail starts in Pittsburgh and follows a small river all the way to Washington D.C. This pedestrian path is perfect for biking and passes right through Ohiopyle town. 

![Great Allegheny Trail at Ohiopyle state park things to do with kids](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1724803301/ohiopyle_state_park_bike_path_group_photo_bfdgc3.jpg "My crew on bikes and a bike trailer")

There are a couple shops to rent bikes from and bike trailers if you need. Or you can bring your own bikes and park in the ample parking near the train station in Ohiopyle. 

We thought we could easily bike from Kentuck campground to Ohiopyle town and to the trail, however, the campground elevation is high and it is a steep downhill ride to get to the elevation of the river. There is a connector trail from the campground to Great Allegheny Trail that is only .43 miles but very steep. You would not want to bike down. You can walk your bike down and up, but with kids that would be challenging. I suggest driving your bikes to the train station parking lot and starting there.

The trail is flat and beautiful. If your kids are older and can bike 11 miles you can bike all the way to the town of Confluence. Just make sure you have enough energy to bike back, or stay the night there!

### Picnic at Tharp Knob Overlook

Ohiopyle has many picnic locations to enjoy the outdoors further. Our favorite was at Tharp Knob, just a short drive from the campground on the way into town. This location had two pavilions with picnic tables, but also a nice picnic table under a tree where we ate at.

Tharp Knob also has a volleyball court and bathrooms. There was advertised a playground, however it was recently torn down. 

![tharp knob overlook things to do with kids at ohiopyle state park](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1724803341/tharp_knob_overlook_all_kids_and_me_nyxffp.jpg "Notice the town of Ohiopyle in the background")

After enjoying your picnic don’t leave without walking up the short trail to the overlook. This is a stunning overlook, one of my favorites, as it looks over Ohiopyle town! Here you can spot the bridge and put into perspective how small the town is surrounded by the Laurel Forest.

### Enjoy the view at Baughman Rock Overlook

I love a good mountain overlook and Baughman Rock overlook doesn’t disappoint. There is a parking lot you can drive to and have a VERY SHORT walk to the overlook. Or you can hike Baughman Trail to reach the overlook by foot. You will need to take from town the Lower Baughman Trail to Baughman Connector Trail and ending with Lower Sugarloaf Trail back to Ohiopyle town.

![Baughman Rock overlook at ohiopyle state park things to do with kids](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1724803312/baughman_rock_overlook_with_hailey_hrqs05.jpg "My 2 year old daughter and me at the overlook")

We opted to drive as the hiking route is multiple miles and my kids weren’t feeling the longer hikes on this trip. If my husband was there we could have tackled more by carrying two of our three children in hiking backpacks, but without him my 4 year old would have struggled.

The overlook is a great shot of the Laurel Highlands and you can sit on the rocks to the right of the fence. Just be careful with kids as the drop is steep.

### Check out Ohiopyle State Park Office

Ohiopyle State Park Office, isn’t just an office. On the bottom floor is a museum about the area as well as some interactive games for the kids. My boys spent nearly an hour down in the lower section and I had to pry them away!

At the back of the museum are glass windows overlooking the Youghinogheny River and Ohiopyle falls. It is a stunning view and worth the staircase down to view.

The state park office also has more information about programs going on, a stamp game for kids, restrooms and a small gift shop.

Once outside the state park office you can take the groomed trails to take a closer look at Ohiopyle waterfalls.

### Hike McCune Trail

Close to Baughman Rock Overlook is McCune Trail. This is a nice relatively flat hike to a view with a bench to rest. The whole hike is 3.7 miles, but you can make it shorter by turning back once you get to the view point instead of doing the loop. To do this start the hike at the parking lot heading into the forest, not near Sugarloaf Road.

The McCune family used to have their homestead here and you will come across some old buildings, a pond, a field and overall nice forest land. My boys found fallen apples from the trees as well as many blueberries all over the trail.

We took some food and had a nice break at the overlook on the bench. 

### Enjoy Ohiopyle Town with Ice Cream and Park Play

Ohiopyle town is small, but does have some fun family friendly activities. These are my favorites

![OHiopyle town things to do with kids at ohiopyle state park](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1724803384/ice_cream_shop_ohiopyle_state_park_town_qvaloi.jpg "My favorite ice cream spot")

1. Ohiopyle Coffee Company: This coffee house has lots of picnic benches set up outside and a large connect 4 set for the kids to play with
2. Kickstand Ice Cream Shop: This is by far my favorite of the ice cream shops in town. The others at Falls Market and General Store feature Galliker’s ice cream which end up being gritty. My kids didn’t eat it. Kickstand has Hershey Ice cream which we preferred.
3. Wilderness Voyageurs Bike Shop: Located right next to the train station.  This bike shop is reasonably priced and has all you need. When my 4 year old didn’t want to ride anymore they rented me just a bike trailer for him and my daughter to ride in together. It was $4 an hour and worked great!
4. Playground: The playground is located across from Paddlers Pizza and is a great spot to let out your kids' energy. My kids made friends here and it was a nice spot to enjoy before heading back to the campground.

### Attend a Free Ranger Program 

Ohiopyle State Park offers free programs. When we were there in August it was only on the weekend days, but worth checking out. The schedule changes week to week so you will have to check out what is going on when you are there.

Our kids loved the otter program held at the amphitheater at the campsite. The ranger was very informative and great with the kids. Other programs offered when we were there were a guided hike and a movie night. 

### Make friends at Kentuck Campground Playground

Not as big as the one in town, but still worth going to daily. This playground features swings and a large climbing structure. It is located next to Yurt 4 and across from the bathrooms on Cherry Road. 

Although do be advised that Ohiopyle State Park is a no spray park and there was poison ivy in the bushes and shrubs near the playground. My 4 year old came home with poison ivy! As long as you stay in the wood chipped area you should be fine.

Every day we were there multiple kids came and went from the playground. It was a great spot to meet other families and have our kids play. It provided a sense of community among the campsite.

## Family Friendly Places Around Ohiopyle State Park

Beyond the state park there are many other family friendly attractions to check out.

### 1.Explore Laurel Caverns

![laurel caverns family friendly spot near Ohiopyle state park pa](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1724803358/laurel_caverns_two_boys_wjk04w.jpg)

[Laurel Caverns](https://laurelcaverns.com/) is about 20 minutes away and worth the drive. The caverns are the largest in PA and have over 4 miles of passages. The caverns are cold, although I was carrying my 2 year old daughter so I never needed a jacket.

The caverns are reasonably priced and include a 30 minute guided tour followed by an optional 30 minute self guided tour. The self guided tour goes about 14 stories underground, so be ready for that climb back up to the surface. I was a ball of sweat by the end!

Also at the caverns your kids can mine for gemstones, a big favorite of my boys. On our way out we stopped by the coffee cart and enjoyed it in the picnic area which had a nice overlook.

### 2. Visit Frank Lloyd Wright Kentuck Knob with Older Kids

[Frank Lloyd Kentuck Knob](https://kentuckknob.com/) is minutes from Kentuck campground. Although I didn’t visit this on my most recent trip,  I have gone there in the past. The main reason we didn’t visit is for house tours children have to be 6 years of age or older. My kids are 2, 4 and 5 for our recent trip. Otherwise younger kids can only tour the Woodland Walk.

Frank Lloyd was known for his architect vision in creating space with nature and beautiful outlooks. It is worth checking out for older families.

### 3. Learn some History at Fort Necessity 

In the nearby town of Farmington, about a 15 minute drive from the campground is Fort Necessity. This is a free family activity that is also educational. When we were there they had a free demonstration on what the Native Americans and French soldiers would wear and carry. The French soldier fired his musket for us and did a great job painting the picture of what life back in the day was.

My 5 year old was scared at times, not having much information about war before and what it all entailed. The 20 minute movie of the battle had him covering his eyes, but also provided him a look into the past.

Fort Necessity showcases the old fort, a museum inside, playground outdoors for kids, a movie and a gift shop.

### 4. Feel Festive at the Christmas Shop

If you are feeling in the holiday spirit you can visit the Christmas shops on Route 40 right near the Christian W Klay Winery next to Fayette Springs Road.

Even though it was August my kids really wanted to stop and look at all the Christmas decorations. 

### 5. Let parents unwind at Christian W Klay Winery

Down the road from the Christmas Shop is [Christian W Klay winery](https://christianklaywinery.com/), which my mother and I really enjoyed. The property is gorgeous with rolling hills in the background and a nice pond for the kids to look at. There is an outdoor pavilion with outdoor seating as well as a bar room.

Since it was raining on the day we were there we sat inside and maybe we were lucky, or this is common, but the manager invited my three screen deprived kids to go into his break room and watch some TV while my mom and I enjoyed a glass of wine and some peace and quiet. We could easily walk to see the kids and we enjoyed our break.

## Final Thoughts on Ohiopyle State Park with Kids

Ohiopyle State Park is a great PA state park to visit with kids and one of my favorites to date. It has endless opportunities for time in nature, places to explore and a convenient town making life easy.

I would highly recommend a family trip and would easily say to stay a week. There is plenty to do and many free options as well. The yurts were a great place to stay, but they do fill up quickly. You might have to book 6+ months in advance. If not in the yurts you can tent camp or bring your RV.
