I talk about my go to camping toys for toddlers below, but my personal favorites are toys that let you engage with nature. My toddlers find endless play with **[Bug Catchers](https://www.amazon.com/Explorer-Binoculars-Flashlight-Magnifying-Butterfly/dp/B07QLM375B?crid=1R1J6CMBSZMWI\&keywords=bug+kit+toddler\&qid=1647461258\&sprefix=bug+kit+toddler%2Caps%2C64\&sr=8-2\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=4884ec6e216cd8b7dd30e0b2e23ee6ba\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)**, toddler **[camera](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088FJ6F1R?_encoding=UTF8\&th=1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=980f192182509dd75373753436745f6b\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)**, **[binoculars](https://www.amazon.com/Living-Squad-Kids-Binoculars-8x21/dp/B07CBSFMTD?crid=20TVB77Y0PY6W\&keywords=living+squad+binoculars\&qid=1647883639\&sprefix=living+squad+binoculars%2Caps%2C149\&sr=8-1-spons\&psc=1\&smid=A3QAMMLVSI378N\&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExOVBEMjVDODQ5WDk4JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNzI5NzY1UFRCU0hOUElSNzM0JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTEwMzY1OTAxRkxVUzFYN0lHQ0M4JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ%3D%3D\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=42f5f02dbda04edbf08d646378283819\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** and [l**anterns**](https://www.amazon.com/Coleman-Kids-Adventure-Mini-Lantern/dp/B01MSK8JLG?crid=EBH9XLZXUJ4Z\&keywords=toddler+lantern\&qid=1647460514\&sprefix=toddler+lantern%2Caps%2C68\&sr=8-5\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=49c5c60ce4537238eeecd3359999c234\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) for when it gets dark.

## How do you entertain a toddler while camping?

![Toddler camping entertainment: Making S'mores](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975299/camping-enteratinment-smores.jpg "Group Campfire with my family")

Nature is a child's first playground and it doesn't take much to keep a toddler entertained in nature. My favorite activities to do with a toddler while camping are:

* Hiking
* Log our camping journal together
* Roast Marshmallows
* Sing Songs
* Go on a toddler scavenger hunt
* Swim

One of the best things to keep a toddler entertained while camping is using camping toys for toddlers for imaginative play.

By the time the big day comes to go camping your toddler should be well versed on what to anticipate. Hopefully that will bring a ton of excitement to your toddler.

## Best Camping Books for Toddlers

I am a big advocate of books and reading to your toddler. A great way to familiarize a toddler with a new concept is by reading to them. My toddlers love to read the same books over and over again and the pictures help them visualize what the words are telling them. 

A camping books for toddlers will help your toddler understand what to expect when they go camping. It gives you and your toddler time to cuddle and talk about camping. It is a great primer for any camping trip you are going to take.

If your toddler doesn’t already have a sleeping bag, now might be the right time to get one. A toddler should have a sleeping bag designed for a shorter person, otherwise there is a risk of suffocation and too much heat loss at night. Kids under the age of 3 shouldn’t use one, however there are other alternatives you can use, such as a wearable toddler sleeping bag.

ANJ Outdoors offers a reasonable priced right size **[toddler sleeping bag](https://www.amazon.com/ANJ-Outdoors-Sleeping-Season-Outdoor/dp/B08FVBK86X?crid=3EI9BTHVGFAAP\&keywords=anj%2Boutdoors%2B32f%2Byouth\&qid=1643901521\&sprefix=anj%2Boutdoors%2B32%2Bf%2Byouth%2Caps%2C141\&sr=8-2\&th=1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=ac4752d071cd7551500c2226b3d43f77\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)**.

My two toddler boys got these **[Coleman lanterns](https://www.amazon.com/Coleman-Kids-Adventure-Mini-Lantern/dp/B01MSK8JLG?crid=EBH9XLZXUJ4Z\&keywords=toddler+lantern\&qid=1647460514\&sprefix=toddler+lantern%2Caps%2C68\&sr=8-5\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=49c5c60ce4537238eeecd3359999c234\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** for Christmas and love to take them out when it is dark to illuminate their play area. The lanterns have been dropped endless time and thrown and they are holding strong with no show of distress. They haven’t used them camping yet, but they are already talking about when they can!

I will say this again, toddlers Love light! Not only will your toddler adore a lantern but also a headlamp. When it gets dark outside when camping your toddler can pop on this **[owl LED headlamp](https://www.amazon.com/Kids-Aubllo-Headlight-Flashlight-Adjustable-Headbands/dp/B08SBWJGMP?crid=7RU71K0G1M17\&keywords=toddler%2Bheadlamp\&qid=1647463023\&sprefix=toddler%2Bheadlamp%2Caps%2C81\&sr=8-39\&th=1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=10b3764e39def6bfeeba867770ff698b\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** and you will always be able to find them. They can use it to read, search for bugs or just hang out.

This will help if you need to leave the tent in the dark or help your toddler not be afraid of the dark.

Binoculars are a classic camping accessory. Your toddler will be able to look out into the wilderness and see what they can find. Binoculars are great for when you go on a hike and want to spot the bird in the distance or search the trail ahead.

![camping gifts for toddlers binoculars](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975302/toddler-camping-gifts-binoculars.jpg "True explores need binoculars to explore the woods")

My boys both love to wear their **[Living Squad binoculars](https://www.amazon.com/Living-Squad-Kids-Binoculars-8x21/dp/B07CBSFMTD?crid=20TVB77Y0PY6W\&keywords=living+squad+binoculars\&qid=1647883639\&sprefix=living+squad+binoculars%2Caps%2C149\&sr=8-1-spons\&psc=1\&smid=A3QAMMLVSI378N\&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExOVBEMjVDODQ5WDk4JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNzI5NzY1UFRCU0hOUElSNzM0JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTEwMzY1OTAxRkxVUzFYN0lHQ0M4JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ%3D%3D\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=42f5f02dbda04edbf08d646378283819\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** and feel like little explorers. The great thing about these binoculars is that they work as intended and can focus on objects at all different distances. Many binoculars made for kids don't actually work.

As your toddlers grow these binoculars will continue to be a staple item he/she takes when outdoors.

My son got this as a gift when he turned 2 and has played with it ever since, and not just while hiking or camping. He will take his kit outside in the backyard and go searching for bugs. I love gifts that can be used in multiple situations.

I am not sure about your toddler, but mine loves taking pictures. He loves to steal my phone and snap away. When on a trip or hiking he loves to snap his own pictures and look through them while back at home. Getting a toddler camera allows your toddler to snap memories from their perspective and have fun afterward looking through them.

I know I don’t trust my toddlers not to drop things in water or on the ground to break. You can even take it on a boat with you if you go fishing or in the lake swimming.

It is never too early to start teaching toddlers safety. Gifting them **[a whistle](https://www.amazon.com/XXINMOH-Referees-Accessories-Emergency-Survival-Sporting/dp/B098LQMYS8?crid=ETJV0WNZIXUK\&keywords=whistle%2Bfor%2Bkids\&qid=1647462055\&sprefix=whistle%2Bfor%2Bkid%2Caps%2C73\&sr=8-14\&th=1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=25bf462212dee907aa99d7b6cc870746\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** and teaching them to blow it when in danger is smart. Toddlers shouldn’t be left alone in the wilderness, but starting them young on learning to whistle when they need help or stranger danger can’t hurt.

Also toddlers love to blow whistles.  I can’t get mine to stop blowing theirs in the house!

### *Toddler Walkie Talkies*

Also has dual purpose, your toddler will love using them around the house and outdoors, not just while camping. **[Selieve Walkie Talkies](https://www.amazon.com/Selieve-Talkies-Channels-Backlit-Flashlight/dp/B07PZCQLJY?crid=2AXZYGJPFM344\&keywords=toddler%2Bwalkie%2Btalkie\&qid=1647462247\&sprefix=toddler%2Bwalkie%2Btalkie%2Caps%2C76\&sr=8-1-spons\&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyUlk4TVVHSjM0MElJJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwOTQwMzI3M1M2S1hDU09HTU5BTiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNjE2NDU0MUdYOFBIOElGRVEySyZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU\&th=1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=4746f05ef3b926c0300db9c5c7bc1c88\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** also doubles as a flashlight and toddlers just love messing around with light!

This set is perfect for the younger kid as it has a key lock function. Meaning it will be hard for them to modify the channel, ensuring it stays on the same channel as the one you are carrying, or an older child. It also is lightweight and has a long range.

A younger child might struggle to eat meals, unless confined in a chair. A toddler camping chair is the perfect solution. The **[Hiccapop chair](https://www.amazon.com/hiccapop-Omniboost-Portable-Grandmas-Tip-Free/dp/B078K1W9B3?crid=1SI2L3C95BPND\&keywords=toddler+camping+chair\&qid=1647462731\&sprefix=toddler+camping+chair%2Caps%2C72\&sr=8-1-spons\&psc=1\&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExRTZDVlhZSjMxMkRIJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODMxNzYyM1E2UDQ1UjdJTkU5WSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMjg3NDAxM1YwVlZUWFBGSFJEMCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU%3D\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=cdb82dd5869004608966defebf5e4ded\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** features a removable tray and when not being used your toddler can get in and out of the chair themselves, just another seating option. When the tray is in use the toddler is fixed and can concentrate on eating.

I use this camping chair with my toddlers and love it. The removable tray is the winner for me. Without the tray my toddlers would not sit still and food would end up everywhere. It can be used in multiple situations from camping to the beach or at a friend’s BBQ.

There are many things a toddler can use a bucket and shovel for when camping which makes it great camping toys for toddlers.

They might collect rocks in the **[buckets](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089NLHDWZ?ie=UTF8\&psc=1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=1ea894c98902544d981df0f8820e0bbf\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** or use the **[shovel](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08XQ464FR?ie=UTF8\&th=1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=24df7ec3f677c4fc06bda72b98d9f8cc\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** to dig a small hole. Perhaps where you are camping there is sand nearby to play in. The possibilities are endless.

A bucket and shovel is one of those toys that can be played with everywhere, especially camping. They are also great on a **[toddler beach](/toddler-beach-essentials)** trip or if your campground has a beach.

### *Bubbles*

Another toddler classic toy. Playing with bubbles outside is a staple and can be enjoyed for many many years. 

**[Bubble wands](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FI4GSLM?_encoding=UTF8\&aaxitk=529e095ce8ab1b8f187cea2d6a1e4a9b\&hsa_cr_id=9927564050201\&pd_rd_plhdr=t\&pd_rd_r=ec888ce1-9868-4c43-ad27-bdaf3916573d\&pd_rd_w=NoJoS\&pd_rd_wg=5QfNC\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=581ea1a0fa192ffb6d7ee4e6ba7d0bd7\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** are a great addition to add fun to a camping trip. Let each child have one around the campfire and watch them be entertained. Just don’t let them empty all the bubbles out by accident, my 2 year old loves to do this!

### *Water bottle*

If you don’t already have an appropriate **[toddler water bottle](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00913CZ5A?ie=UTF8\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=e7e938a348193cd40ffa8aa4f17e0314\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** to take camping, then a brand new water bottle is perfect. Toddlers love to have their own gear and a toddler size water bottle comes in handy. 

Adult sizes are too large for little hands and I don’t personally like sharing my water bottle with my kiddos, especially if one is slightly under the weather.
