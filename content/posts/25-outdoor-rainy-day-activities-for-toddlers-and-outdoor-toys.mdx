A rainy day doesn’t have to mean a day inside, toddlers love getting wet and splashing in all the puddles. The bigger the puddles the better, according to them. Looking for great outdoor rainy day activities? I got you covered.

First order of business ensure your toddler is dressed for the wet. You can read my article on **[Best Rain Gear for Toddlers](/best-rain-gear-for-toddlers/)** to get you started.

Once you cover your toddler’s outer layer, make sure they are dressed appropriately below their rain gear. In colder weather add more warm layers below! Toddlers can get very cranky when they are cold.

## **Safety Tips for Playing In The Rain With A Toddler**

5. Make sure their footwear is appropriate to reduce chances of slipping 

7. Always supervise your toddler

## Best **Rainy Day Toys for Playing Outside With A Toddler**

No special toy is needed for fun in the rain. Splashing in puddles and the use of their imagination is enough to keep them entertained. However, toys can increase the length of play outside or add to their enjoyment.

Below are the top normal toys my toddlers love to use in the rain.

### Toddler Scooter

Scooting through puddles and splashing the water around is pretty exciting. My 3 year old always grabs for his **[scooter](https://www.amazon.com/Scooters-Suitable-Adjustable-Removable-Activities/dp/B07JBB6YJQ?crid=15IG86F4TJ89T&keywords=skidee+scooter&qid=1644690885&s=sporting-goods&sprefix=skidee+scoote%2Csporting%2C146&sr=1-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFLSURMWUc4MjFXWCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRJZD1BMDkzMDYzODFJVlNJTDZERVVQS1omZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDczMzI1OTFUWVEzRlAyTVRHR0gmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl&linkCode=ll1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=bb349bc666bcdbb349ee79067cba1b4c&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** when I take him out in the rain. He finds the biggest puddle he can and rides his scooter through it over and over again.

### Toddler Bike

Just like a scooter, **[a bike](https://www.amazon.com/Strider-Sport-Balance-Months-Years/dp/B00IZXCB1A?crid=55YU6626A8IX&keywords=strider%2B12%2Bsport%2Bbalance&qid=1644166700&sprefix=strider%2B12%2Bsport%2Bbalance%2B%2Caps%2C131&sr=8-2&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=ef19570b67e5ae8952912127c749c6a7&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** is equally as fun to ride through the puddles. Watching the tires hit the water and spraying water along as you go. Talk about optimal childhood memories.

### Bucket and shovel

Watch as the rain collects in buckets, or use the **[buckets](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089NLHDWZ?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=e088b2c528e7293da59d10af9a12f26b&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** to scoop up water. Toddlers will find many different ways to use buckets in the rain. A favorite of my toddlers is to transfer water from one bucket to another and back again.

<AffiliateLink affiliateSnippet="" button={false} image="" imageURL="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B089NLHDWZ&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&language=en_US" linkURL="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089NLHDWZ?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=li2&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=f593da74b42ac14454ee2f02498ebe6b&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" />

 The **[shovel](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08XQ464FR?ie=UTF8&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=a30ec1ef706e1a258c7dd0cb455a3b41&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** is often used as well to add mud to the water or small pebbles or rocks. After a rainy day outside, play baths are normally on the cards!

<AffiliateLink affiliateSnippet="" button={false} image="" imageURL="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B08XQ464FR&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&language=en_US" linkURL="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08XQ464FR?ie=UTF8&th=1&linkCode=li2&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=9d45ab4a59af0ea9ec05defc54e97d6f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" />

See how many outdoor rainy day activities your toddler can think of using a shovel and a bucket! Mine find at least 5 ways to play with them!

### Trucks

Pushing [**outdoor trucks**](https://www.amazon.com/Green-Toys-Dump-Truck-Yellow/dp/B001Q3KU9Q?keywords=green+toy+trucks&qid=1639849131&s=toys-and-games&sr=1-4&linkCode=ll1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=68fe0ec10b7774fb2c806606716cab6d&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) around gets more entertaining in the rain. A dump truck can collect water, mud or pinecones and your toddler can push the truck around and empty it into puddles or wherever. Just stand back and watch your toddler’s imagination at work. 

<AffiliateLink affiliateSnippet="" button={false} image="" imageURL="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B001Q3KU9Q&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&language=en_US" linkURL="https://www.amazon.com/Green-Toys-Dump-Truck-Yellow/dp/B001Q3KU9Q?keywords=green+toy+trucks&qid=1639849131&s=toys-and-games&sr=1-4&linkCode=li2&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=a7e2162efb5ca26581b3df0d2f3ef4f0&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" />

### Water table

**[Water tables](https://www.amazon.com/Step2-Duck-Dive-Water-Table/dp/B07BFQDHH4?crid=22LODQ0Z1LMUJ&keywords=water+table&qid=1646859272&s=toys-and-games&sprefix=water+tabl%2Ctoys-and-games%2C90&sr=1-12&linkCode=ll1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=5fafc79498fb6eb2b7a66b3335bbb2ed&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** are great for sensory play and in warmer weather. The addition of rain as your toddler plays at their water table will add a new dimension to their play. The table will fill up with more water and be less work for you; you no longer have to keep refilling the table as they inevitably dump water out.

### Rubber Ducks

I don’t know what it is about **[rubber ducks](https://www.amazon.com/Novelty-Place-Float-Squeak-Rubber/dp/B00XI0971W?crid=H7UO4GOUMQHR&keywords=rubber+duck&qid=1646859390&s=toys-and-games&sprefix=rubber+duck%2Ctoys-and-games%2C127&sr=1-18&linkCode=ll1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=a614c7e66dbe9359c4c903318712bd8f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)**, but toddlers love them. Place them in a puddle or a small stream and watch as they move with the water. Ducks are the perfect size for a toddler's hand and a great rain toy!
