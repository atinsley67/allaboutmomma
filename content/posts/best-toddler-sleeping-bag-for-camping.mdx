## Considerations to Find Best Toddler Sleeping Bags

![choices for toddler and baby sleeping bags for camping](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975432/toddler-sleeping-bag-options.jpg "Left: Toddler size sleeping bag Middle: Toddler size wearable sleeping bag Right: Baby size wearable sleeping bag")

### *What does your toddler sleep in at home?*

If they are still sleeping in a sleep sack a wearable sleeping bag might be best.

If your toddler is used to a bed and blankets a toddler sleeping bag might be the winner.

### *How many people will be sleeping in the tent?* 

More bodies in a small space will generate heat. If you have more space in your tent you might be able to bring a toddler cot to sleep on or even a pack-n-play, depending on what your toddler is used to.

### *What temperatures do you plan on camping at?*

Sleeping bags and options are rated up to different temperatures. When purchasing a product you want to ensure it will be warm enough for your toddler. 

### *Will you be hiking to your camping spot or driving to it?*

If you have to hike to your destination the product's weight is a big concern. If you are driving then you will not have a weight limit, but trunk space limit.

### *What type of insulation is best for a toddler?* 

Sleeping bags/wearables come in either a synthetic or down insulation. **Down insulation is lighter** for its weight, however is very pricy. **Synthetic insulation is heavier per weight**, however performs better in wet or moist conditions. Given most do not want to spend $300+ on a toddler sleeping bag that will be used for a couple of years, all toddler sleeping bags come in synthetic insulation, at least that I can find. 

However, you will have some **down options if you choose a wearable sleeping bag or blanket** for your toddler.

## Are Sleeping Bags Safe for Toddlers?

Sleeping bags are **not safe** for toddlers under the age of 3. Before 3 your toddler might wiggle down into the sleeping bag and suffocate. There are other alternatives for a younger toddler to sleep while camping.

For a toddler over the age of 3 yes, however the sleeping bag **should NOT** be an adult size sleeping bag, but a child size. 

![two advertised toddler sleeping bags](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975433/toddler-sleeping-bag-comparison.jpg "Right photo is ANZ sleeping bag made for a toddler, up to 4'5\". Left photo was advertised fits kids and adults, but clearly is too big for a toddler. Also the width of a toddler sleeping bag is smaller.")

Sleeping bags work by using one’s body heat to keep them warm overnight. If the sleeping bag is too large for their size the warmth is being lost and not keeping your toddler warm.

You should also ensure the sleeping bag is the right size for the person sleeping in it. For toddlers I recommend the smallest size which are sleeping bags for kids up to **4’ 5”**. **Mummy style sleeping bags** are the warmest.

![A sleeping bag is the right size](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1687635684/anz-toddler-sleeping-bag-lucas-1_wauciv.webp)![A sleeping bag which is too big](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1687635618/toddler-sleeping-bag-too-big_xfp22n.webp)

Sleeping bag on left is appropriately sized for a toddler. You can see how the head opening is smaller and fits a toddler better than the right photo which is too large

Options are limited at this size, but still a couple different options to choose from. I go over my top picks soon.

## What are Alternatives to Sleeping Bags for Toddlers?

The alternatives to sleeping bags are sleeping quilts and wearable sleeping bags. 

### How do toddler sleeping quilts outside work?

A sleeping quilt does not confine a toddler as a zippered sleeping bag and can be a good alternative for a **younger toddler**. 

A toddler sleeping quilts is normally used with a sleeping pad on the ground of a tent. Or you can use a sleeping cot with a quilt depending on available size of tent and carrying capacity.

A sleeping quilt is a blanket that your toddler can use as their comforter, just like at home. This option is best when camping during warmer months of the year. Your toddler will sleep on the **sleeping pad or cot directly with a blanket on top.**

I use my **[Regalo My Cot](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H1MRJO?ie=UTF8\&th=1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=4694eb7c2fc45349d49c0c5130ba0c84\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** if the tent is large enough with my toddler. To read more about this cot check out **[Best Travel Toddler Bed](/best-portable-toddler-travel-bed)**.

  }}
/>

#### Pros of sleeping quilts/blankets:

* If your toddler is already use to a blanket this works great
* No worry of toddler not able to get out and suffocating
* Multiple uses other than sleeping, stadium blanket or sitting around a fire
* Lightweight option and can come in down insulation (if preferred)

#### Cons of sleeping Quilts/blankets

* Airflow can escape on the sides
* Toddler can kick it off and be left uncovered

Great option is **[Horizon Hound Down Camping Blanket](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079TNM7SD?_encoding=UTF8\&psc=1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=ab81e1e06a8873c41c0ca62ae7fd6425\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)**. It only weighs **a pound and packages up small**. The blanket is made from ripstop nylon outer shell and has a **down insulation filling made of 80%down and 20% feathers.**

### What is a wearable toddler sleeping bag?

This is a great option for a young toddler. This is a sleeping bag you wear that is like a sleep sack. The young toddler has no way to cover their face and will stay warm. A toddler can wear and sleep directly on a sleeping pad, cot or even a pack-n-play (if you have the space).

## *Best Wearable Toddler Sleeping Bag*

##### Little Mo 20 Sleeping Bag or Big Mo 20 Sleeping Bag

Morrison Outdoor makes a wearable sleeping bag in two different sizes, one for a baby to **[young toddler](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086PZQ6YS?_encoding=UTF8\&psc=1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=29c740f2a20c799b14d4878cbab53508\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** (6-24 months) and an **[older toddler](https://www.amazon.com/Sleeping-Lightest-Warmest-RDS-Certified-Minimal/dp/B08847CNTL?crid=3UP7M7IMOM2W9\&keywords=big+mo+20\&qid=1643901127\&s=sporting-goods\&sprefix=big+mo+2%2Csporting%2C377\&sr=1-2\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=1352275046e950b4dbe2573774571071\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** (2-4 years old).

The sleeping bag features sleeves that are closed ensuring your toddler’s hand stays warm. The fill type is **100% RDS insulated down** with an **outer layer made of water-resistant ripstop nylon.** The product weighs very little (9 and 13 oz respectively). The footbox is fully enclosed and has a **two way zipper.**

The **sleeping bag compresses to the size of a water bottle** making it easy to pack either in the car or in the hiking backpack. 

You can feel good about purchasing from this company. A portion of their sales goes to charities. Also they have a **trade-in program** for when your toddler outgrows it.

The best and only sleeping bag for a baby is a wearable sleeping bag. Normal sleeping bags **ARE NOT SAFE.** A normal sleeping bag can suffocate a baby as it can a young toddler.
