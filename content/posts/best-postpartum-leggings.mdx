Immediately after having a baby your pre-pregnancy clothes are not going to fit. A great addition you should add to your postpartum wardrobe is postpartum leggings. Postpartum leggings are comfortable and flattering making them perfect for postpartum.

![collection of my postpartum leggings](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975389/postpartum-leggings.jpg)

The best postpartum leggings will make you never want to take them off. They often come with pockets to keep your phone on hand; never know when you will want to snap another picture of your baby. They help to conceal your midsection and feel positive about yourself.

The best part of postpartum leggings is that they are very affordable and come in many designs and colors! I personally own many pairs and live in these pants after having all three of my babies, so far!

## **What are Postpartum Leggings**?

Postpartum leggings are **comfortable, soft and help to compress your midsection**. These types of leggings are often made by yoga and outdoor companies.

These leggings are **meant to stretch** and are made of a thick material so you have no concern of them being see-through. 

In your postpartum time you want your clothes to be comfortable and help to conceal your larger body shape, think contour your body. It will take time for you to get back to your pre-pregnancy shape and sometimes you won’t fully get back; that is okay too!

We just spent 9 months growing a human being and right now is the time to be kind to ourselves and marvel about what our bodies just did. And of course enjoy the new baby that is now part of your family.

![my Phisockat Postpartum leggings](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975390/postpartum-leggings-mainshot.jpg "2 weeks postpartum me wearing Phisockat leggings")

## **Why Do You Need Postpartum Leggings?**

Hopefully someone told you that you will not automatically be back to your pre-pregnancy shape. This will take time and for 6-8 weeks your stomach will still appear as if you are pregnant as your uterus will need time to shrink.

![my collection of postpartum leggings](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975390/my-postpartum-leggings.jpg)

> “From the moment your baby is born, hormonal changes cause your uterus to contract, shrinking it back to its pre-pregnancy state. It takes six to eight weeks for your uterus to return to its normal size.All the cells in your body that swelled during pregnancy begin to release the extra fluid, which is eliminated from your body through urine, vaginal secretions, and sweat.”
> 
> BabyCenter [**Article**](https://www.babycenter.com/baby/postpartum-health/post-baby-belly-how-long-you-might-look-pregnant_1152349#:~:text=It%20takes%20six%20to%20eight,%2C%20vaginal%20secretions%2C%20and%20sweat.)

After you give birth you want to be comfortable, you don’t want to be trying to squeeze into jeans or have your self confidence hit a low spot when you realize nothing but your pregnancy clothes fit. 

Here is where postpartum leggings come in! They are comfortable to wear after having a baby, help control your midsection and are flattering to be seen in. I promise no plumbers crack with these leggings!

You will be able to bend down, feed the baby, slowly start walking and not have to worry about changing pants or constantly pulling your pants up. And the best part is that postpartum leggings don’t cost that much money!

## **Main Qualities To Look For In Postpartum Leggings**

1. How **high the waist** is/ tummy control
    - Your stomach will still be enlarged after birth and just like pregnancy clothes having a high waist helps to conceal and streamline your midsection. 

3. **Length of the legging**
    - Leggings come in capri style or full length, if you give birth in summer you might enjoy the capri style and if it is winter time you will want the full length.

5. Choice **of pockets**
    - This is a personal choice. Do you like leggings that give you the option to pocket your phone? When your little one falls asleep on you or gives you their first smile you can easily retrieve your phone with pockets.

7. **Thickness** of the leggings
    - You most certainly want leggings that are thick enough not to be see-through, but just how thick might depend on the season you give birth. 

## Top 5 Best Postpartum Leggings

All my top choices for postpartum leggings are below. I find myself mainly wearing postpartum leggings for the first year after each of my children are born.

If you have a C-section I would suggest you purchase a pair where the waistband goes above the belly button! I had 3 C-sections and the last thing you want is material rubbing against your incision.

The company also provides a **30 day guarantee**.

Ewedoos leggings have **3 pockets** as the previous two brands. What I love more about Ewedoos is that the **outer pockets are a touch higher** on the pants than Phisockat and Fengay leggings. It holds my phone better when walking and running.

The leggings are offered in both capri and full length and in many different colors. However, not as many colors and designs as other brands.

Similar to Phisockat’s material the Ewedoos material is 75% polyester and 25% spandex making a **nice soft-feel legging**. Besides wearing these for active wear, I am more than happy to wear them all day long!

## Other Uses For Postpartum Leggings:

These leggings won’t just get used immediately after having a baby. All these options are great for workout pants and especially yoga pants or don’t forget your lazy day hanging around the house.

I would recommend buying a new pair for just after birth, if you already have them. The tight compression right after having a baby is worth it. If you were wearing the leggings before you gave birth you might have stretched out the high waist.  You will want a new pair  to provide the best compression afterbirth.
