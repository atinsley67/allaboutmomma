Nothing can be more exciting to a toddler than snow! Waking up running to the window and seeing white powder on the ground will get your toddler wanting to go outside.

## **Toddler Snow Boots** Overview

There are several considerations I look for when purchasing a snow boot for my toddler. I want it to be practical, some winter boots on the market are designed for fashion rather than playing in the snow. My main goal is to have a snow boot for my toddler where their feet stay warm and dry.

Or if you are like me, I want boots my toddlers can also hike in the snow with. If you want to read more about hiking read my **[Hiking with Toddler Guide](https://allaboutmomma.com/equipment-needed-to-hike-with-your-toddler/)**.

I don't **consider boots that have any of the following:**

- Laces, completely impractical for a toddler

- Not insulated

- Not made with decent waterproof qualities

- Not have tread on bottom of boots

### Qualities to look for in a toddlers snow boots

- **Height** of shaft of snow boot
    - How tall the back of the boot is (how high up the leg the boot goes)

- Closure of the snow boot 

- **Thickness** of insulation

- Reflective qualities of the snow boot

- The material the toddler snow boot is made from

- Waterproofness of the boot 

## **Best Toddler Snow Boots**

### Northside Boys Girls Toddler/Kid Frosty Insulated Winter Snow Boot

<AffiliateLink affiliateSnippet="" button={false} image="" imageURL="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B004QLAS7Y&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&language=en_US" linkURL="https://www.amazon.com/Northside-Frosty-Winter-Toddler-Little/dp/B004QLAS7Y?crid=23C0AP1UG5XLB&keywords=northside+boys+girls+frosty+insulated+winter+snow+boot&qid=1642293291&sprefix=northside+boys+girls+frosty+insulated+winter+snow+boot%2Caps%2C80&sr=8-2&linkCode=li3&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=d99570935d951763c7c8c56a3eaa4960&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" />

**[Northside](https://www.amazon.com/Northside-Frosty-Winter-Toddler-Little/dp/B004QLAS7Y?crid=23C0AP1UG5XLB&keywords=northside+boys+girls+frosty+insulated+winter+snow+boot&qid=1642293291&sprefix=northside+boys+girls+frosty+insulated+winter+snow+boot%2Caps%2C80&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=b0bb051c72b9a2974f0a8aa48b870a19&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** makes a very affordable quality snow boot for toddlers that hits all my desired qualities. Both my boys have a pair and their feet stay 100% dry every time.

Northside provides a wide selection of 28 different colors and designs, with some designs a premium cost. The snow boot closes with a **velcro strap** across the ankle and has an elastic cord closure at the top. 

The boot has a **heel pull** to help get on, and this is my only real complaint. The boot does take longer than a shoe to put on, but once on will **not** come off and keeps their feet dry.

![Toddler snowboots in the snow sledding](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975436/lucas-toddler-snowboots-sledding.jpg "My toddler wearing Northside black toddler snowbotos")

The snow boot has a **\-25 degree active rating.** It features a berber lining, which is a man-made lightweight fabric known for its furlike quality, softness and ability to remove moisture. 

The boot is the only one with a **reflective strip** on the back of the boot running up the shaft. The shaft is the longest of my selection at 8 inches. 

The sole is man made from **thermoplastic rubber (TPR)**. TPR provides better traction and is environmentally friendlier than rubber, and waterproof. The upper material is 100% nylon resistant.

The toddler snow boot price and quality cannot be beaten.

#### Pros of Northside Toddler Snowboot

- Elastic cord with cinch toggle at top of boot

- Adjustable velcro strap closure

- TRP waterproof sole with traction

- Removable and washable insole

- Heel pull with reflective safety stripe

- 200g of insulation

#### Cons of Northside Toddler Snowboot

- A few complaints of reviews having issues with fuzzy layer on bottom of sole

- Snow might buildup on sole (i personally haven’t had this issue)

### Sorel Children’s Snow Commander Boot-

<AffiliateLink affiliateSnippet="" button={false} image="" imageURL="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B07KJZLTNL&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&language=en_US" linkURL="https://www.amazon.com/Sorel-Youth-Commander-Boots-Black/dp/B07KJZLTNL?keywords=sorel+children%27s+snow+commander+boot+-+waterproof&qid=1642293444&sprefix=sorel+children%27s+snow%2Caps%2C70&sr=8-1&linkCode=li3&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=52c9e1842803d77c3bbb2c90fa778bb0&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" />

The **[Sorel toddler snow boot](https://www.amazon.com/Sorel-Youth-Commander-Boots-Black/dp/B07KJZLTNL?keywords=sorel+children%27s+snow+commander+boot+-+waterproof&qid=1642293444&sprefix=sorel+children%27s+snow%2Caps%2C70&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=a3676c91594487b9b739388273dcf604&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** will keep your toddler’s feet warm, cozy and dry in the snow. The snowboot is more expensive than Northside, but a great choice.

The company offers a selection of 8 different color snow boots all featuring their **adorable bear logo** on the side. The boot closes with a **thick velcro strap** about ¾ of the way up the boot. 

The boot has a shaft height of 5 ½ inches. This is shorter than the Northside pair and makes it easier to take the boot on and off your toddler's foot.

The sole is made from **thermal rubber**, is waterproof and built with traction. The upper material is Polyurethane backed making it waterproof. The boot has an **inner fleece lining** to keep those toddlers' feet warm. 

I personally love this choice, but the cheaper price, reflective quality, removable and washable sole and taller shaft height won for my personal favorite snow boot.

#### Pros of Sorel Snow Commander Boot

- Easy on and off

- Adjustable velcro strap closure

- Thermal rubber sole designed for enhanced traction

- Polyurethane backing upper material for waterproof

- Fleece Lining

- Cute bear logo

#### Cons of Sorel Snow Commander Boot

- No reflective stripe

- No removable sole

If you are looking for a **toddler snow boot** that is quick to put on and take off, the **[North Face](https://www.amazon.com/North-Face-Toddler-Alpenglow-Black/dp/B07NDFZ2R9?crid=2618L3UNKK9R6&keywords=north+face+toddler+alpenglow+2+insulated+snow+boot&qid=1642293555&sprefix=north+face+toddler+alpenglow+2+insulated+snow+boot%2Caps%2C59&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=317eec6e9082f79802094757ece567eb&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** toddler boot is a great choice. Perhaps you live where it is cold and you need a snow boot for quick trips outside, this is your boot.

The shaft size is the **shortest** which is the key factor in making it the easiest snow boot to take on and off. The snow boot currently has 4 different style choices and is solidly built.

The snow boot closes with a **velcro strap.** The tongue and body of the boot are held together by a flexible elastic fabric ensuring a tighter closure when the velcro strap is secure.

The snow boot features a **thermoplastic rubber (TPR)** sole, like Northside which is great for waterproof and traction. The upper boot is made with **nylon ballistic-mesh.** Ballistic-mesh was engineered in war time and made for its highly abrasion resistance, durability and strong weave quality. This snow boot was built to last.

The boot uses **200g recycled polyester fiber insulation** “Heatseeker” ensuring your feet stay warm. It is eco friendly and a great selection for the lining of the snow boots.

As mentioned this boot is the shortest boot and might not be the best in large snowfalls. It is also the lightest boot making it easiest for a toddler to walk around in. Could be great for **quick trips** and for warmth if you live in a cold climate.

#### Pros of North Face Toddler Aplenglow 2 Snow Boot

- Easy on and off

- Velcro closure with elastic band from tongue to boot

- 200g Heatseeker Eco insulation

- TPR sole

- Ballistic-mesh nylon upper material

#### Cons North Face Toddler Aplenglow 2 Snow Boot

- No reflective qualities

- Shortest shaft height

### Apakowa Kids’ Winter Snow Boots (Toddler/Little Kid) 

<AffiliateLink affiliateSnippet="" button={false} image="" imageURL="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B07H47Y4MF&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&language=en_US" linkURL="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H47Y4MF?&linkCode=li3&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=e232c6281ec0a4ed8b9a02c5bfca0604&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" />

Apakowa offers a great **[tall toddler snow boot](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H47Y4MF?&linkCode=ll1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=309c0fb3774c0825aca964692119765a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** that is designed for easier on and off. The boot is priced in the middle of the snow boots and has about 10 different style options.

This snow boot features a **double velcro hook and loop closure**, making it easier to take on and off than Northside snowboot, which only has one lower down on the boot.

The boot has a **7 ½ inch shaft**, comparable to Northside’s 8 inch. The boot is made from a durable synthetic snow proof upper material. The inside has a faux **woolen/fur lining** providing a cozy feel. The sole is also synthetic and provides texture and slip resistance. I personally prefer TPR or rubber bottoms, but this is still a great option.

#### Pros of Apakowa Winter boots

- Double velcro hook and loop closure for easier on and off

- Warm fuzzy lining

- Textured and slip proof bottom design

#### Cons of Apakowa Winter boots

- No reflective qualities

- No rubber or TPR sole

- Material not as durable as other options

## **Best Toddler Winter Socks Overview**

My main goal as a mom of toddlers in winter is to make sure my kids are warm enough outside. That includes making sure they have a thicker warmer sock to keep those feet warm. 

I love being outside with my toddlers in all the seasons. Winter is a great time for hiking and playing in snow and I want socks to keep those feet warm.

The best winter socks are made out of merino wool. Merino wool has a finer fiber making them even softer and warmer than traditional wool, however comes with a higher price tag. 

### Other Benefits of Merino Wool for Socks

- Absorbing capabilities

- Odor-resistant

- Keeps feet dry while insulating heat

- Lightweight

- Elasticity that allows for stretch but returns to original shape

If price is a concern a combination of wool and other materials will make a more reasonably priced sock than a 100% merino wool sock.

### Things to Consider When Buying a Toddler Winter Sock

- **Material of the sock**

- **Height of the sock** - too high a sock impractical for a toddler, but a sock too short might cause blister with boots or not warm the foot enough.

Meriwool offers a great **[toddler warm merino wool winter sock](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P7XPKCH?&linkCode=ll1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=4d60f0109610977b855dde3323a569a2&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** for a reasonable price. Most toddlers will fit size X-small (US 6-8.5) or size small (US 9-11.5). Although the product is known to run small so consider sizing up!

The sock is offered in four different designs in pinks and blues. The sock is made from **75% merino blend material**, 15% durable nylon to reduce wear and tear and 10% elastic to retain sock shape.

The Merinowool has **natural odor-resistance quality** and ability to keep moisture away keeping a toddler's feet warm and dry. It also features a thick cushion bottom, **reinforced heel and toe**, compression, and a smooth knit toe seam. 

The socks come to the mid calf on a toddler, a perfect height for a winter sock!

#### Pros of Meriwool Merino Wool Socks:

- Keep toddlers feet warm and dry

- 90 day guarantee satisfaction

- Odor-resistant and water absorption quality

- Merino wool blend is 75% 

- Reinforced toe and heel

- Ultra soft feel

The company provides about 20 different style options and comes in a 6 pack for about a price of a 3 pack from Merino Wool Socks.

The socks are made of **55% wool**, 25% cotton, 15% polyester and 5% spandex. All material used is **eco friendly** and non toxic. My toddlers and I don't find them itchy at all, but rather soft to the touch and do great at keeping kids' feet warm and toasty.

![toddler warm winter socks - wool keeps them warm](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975437/toddler-winter-socks-compressed.jpg "My boys wearing Antsang Wool Socks on a cold day")

We use these socks under their snow boots as well as on cold days. The socks are thick so if your toddlers shoes are a snug fit you might have an issue, but I tend to get winter shoes/boots with extra room.

The socks come up a **couple inches above the ankles**, a bit lower than the Meriwool Merino socks. I personally have no issues with the height of the socks, it more than covers the gap of where the pants fall and the shoes start on too small clothes.

#### Pros of Antsang Kids Wool Hiking Socks:

- Cannot beat the price for 6 pairs

- Eco friendly and non toxic material used

- Over 50% wool

- Soft non-itchy feel

- Lots of design choice

- Keeps feet warm and dry

#### Cons of Antsang Kids Wool Hiking Socks

- Not as soft as merino wool

- You will want a longer sock if using for skiing
