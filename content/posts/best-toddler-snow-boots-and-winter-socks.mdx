Nothing can be more exciting to a toddler than snow! Waking up, running to the window and seeing fresh white powder on the ground will have your toddler running for their jacket. This might even be their first snow! But one thing your toddler **WILL **need is a great pair of toddler snow boot and warm toddler winter socks!

## Toddler Snow Boots Overview

There are several considerations I look for when purchasing a snow boot for my toddler. I want it to be practical, some toddler winter boots on the market are designed for fashion rather than playing in the snow. My main goal is to have a snow boot for my toddler to keep their feet warm and dry. 

![My son wearing great toddler snow boots and warm winter socks for toddlers to play in the snow](http://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1725581564/charlie_sledding_on_snow_mountain_p2nzzu.jpg "My toddler son butt sledding down the snow hill")

Or if you are like me, I want boots my toddlers snow boots something they can also hike in the snow with. If you want to read more about hiking read my **[Hiking with Toddler Guide](/equipment-needed-to-hike-with-your-toddler)**.

I don't **consider boots that have any of the following:**

<OutlineBox>
  * Laces, completely impractical for a toddler
  * Not insulated
  * Not made with decent waterproof qualities
  * Not have tread on bottom of boots
</OutlineBox>

### Qualities to look for in a Toddlers Snow Boots

* **Height** of shaft of snow boot
  * How tall the back of the boot is (how high up the leg the boot goes)
* Closure of the snow boot 
* **Thickness** of insulation
* Reflective qualities of the snow boot
* The material the toddler snow boot is made from
* Waterproofness of the boot

**[Northside](https://www.amazon.com/Northside-Frosty-Winter-Toddler-Little/dp/B004QLAS7Y?crid=23C0AP1UG5XLB\&keywords=northside+boys+girls+frosty+insulated+winter+snow+boot\&qid=1642293291\&sprefix=northside+boys+girls+frosty+insulated+winter+snow+boot%2Caps%2C80\&sr=8-2\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=b0bb051c72b9a2974f0a8aa48b870a19\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** makes a very affordable quality snow boot for toddlers that hits all my desired qualities. Both my boys have a pair and their feet stay 100% dry every time. It has now been passed down to my daughter.

Northside provides a wide selection of 28 different colors and designs, with some designs a premium cost. The snow boot closes with a **velcro strap** across the ankle and has an elastic cord closure at the top. 

The boot has a **heel pull** to help get on, and this is my only real complaint. The boot does take longer than a shoe to put on, but once on will **not** come off and keeps their feet dry.

![Toddler snowboots in the snow sledding](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975436/lucas-toddler-snowboots-sledding.jpg "My toddler wearing Northside black toddler snowbotos")

The snow boot has a **-25 degree active rating.** It features a berber lining, which is a man-made lightweight fabric known for its fur-like quality, softness and ability to remove moisture. 

The boot is the only one with a **reflective strip** on the back of the boot running up the shaft. The shaft is the longest of my selection at 8 inches. Again great for not letting snow in, but can be harder to get on.

The sole is man made from **thermoplastic rubber (TPR)**. TPR provides better traction and is environmentally friendlier than rubber, and waterproof. The upper material is 100% nylon resistant.

The toddler snow boot price cannot be beaten, but you might have some snow build up on the bottom. I find most toddler snow boots have this issue.

#### Pros of Northside Toddler Snow Boots

<OutlineBox>
  * Elastic cord with cinch toggle at top of boot
  * Adjustable velcro strap closure
  * TRP waterproof sole with traction
  * Removable and washable insole
  * Heel pull with reflective safety stripe
  * 200g of insulation
</OutlineBox>

#### Cons of Northside Toddler Snow Boots

* A few complaints of reviews having issues with fuzzy layer on bottom of sole
* More difficult to put on
* Snow might buildup on sole

The **[Sorel toddler snow boot](https://www.amazon.com/Sorel-Youth-Commander-Boots-Black/dp/B07KJZLTNL?keywords=sorel+children%27s+snow+commander+boot+-+waterproof\&qid=1642293444\&sprefix=sorel+children%27s+snow%2Caps%2C70\&sr=8-1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=a3676c91594487b9b739388273dcf604\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** will keep your toddler’s feet warm, cozy and dry in the snow. This toddler  snow boot is more expensive than Northside, but a great choice. Sorel often have sales so keep checking!

The company offers a selection of 8 different color snow boots all featuring their **adorable bear logo** on the side. The boot closes with a **thick velcro strap** about ¾ of the way up the boot. 

The boot has a shaft height of 5 ½ inches. This is shorter than the Northside pair and makes it** easier to take the boot on and off** your toddler's foot. An older toddler will be able to put on themselves.

The sole is made from **thermal rubber**, is waterproof and built with traction. The upper material is Polyurethane backed making it waterproof. The boot has an **inner fleece lining** to keep those toddlers' feet warm. 

![4 year old in sorel snow boots for toddlers](http://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1723303341/sorel_toddler_snowboot_b9dlpn.jpg "Son in Sorel Snow Boots")

I personally love this choice, especially when you find them on sale which I did! I got a pair for my 3 year old and loved how easy he found it to put on and secure on his foot. A win for a mom who doesn't have time to always help put on their kids snow boots!

Also the snow build up is less on the sole, but not completely free of snow.

#### Pros of Sorel Snow Commander Boot

<OutlineBox>
  * Easy on and off
  * Adjustable velcro strap closure
  * Thermal rubber sole designed for enhanced traction
  * Polyurethane backing upper material for waterproof
  * Fleece Lining
  * Cute bear logo

#### Cons of Sorel Snow Commander Boot

* No reflective stripe
* No removable sole

If you are looking for a **toddler snow boot** that is quick to put on and take off, the **[North Face](https://www.amazon.com/North-Face-Toddler-Alpenglow-Black/dp/B07NDFZ2R9?crid=2618L3UNKK9R6\&keywords=north+face+toddler+alpenglow+2+insulated+snow+boot\&qid=1642293555\&sprefix=north+face+toddler+alpenglow+2+insulated+snow+boot%2Caps%2C59\&sr=8-1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=317eec6e9082f79802094757ece567eb\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** toddler boot is a great choice. Perhaps you live where it is cold and you need a snow boot for quick trips outside, this is your boot.

The shaft size is the **shortest** which is the key factor in making it the easiest snow boot to take on and off. The snow boot currently has 4 different style choices and is solidly built.

The snow boot closes with a **velcro strap.** The tongue and body of the boot are held together by a flexible elastic fabric ensuring a tighter closure when the velcro strap is secure.

The snow boot features a **thermoplastic rubber (TPR)** sole, like Northside which is great for waterproof and traction. The upper boot is made with **nylon ballistic-mesh.** Ballistic-mesh was engineered in war time and made for its highly abrasion resistance, durability and strong weave quality. This snow boot was built to last.

The boot uses **200g recycled polyester fiber insulation** “Heatseeker” ensuring your feet stay warm. It is eco friendly and a great selection for the lining of the snow boots.

As mentioned this boot is the shortest shalf size and might not be the best in large snowfalls. It is also the lightest boot making it easiest for a toddler to walk around in. Could be great for **quick trips** and for warmth if you live in a cold climate.

#### Pros of North Face Toddler Aplenglow 2 Snow Boot

<OutlineBox>
  * Easy on and off

The boot is priced in the middle of the snow boots and has about 10 different style options.

This snow boot features a **double velcro hook and loop closure**, making it easier to take on and off than Northside snow boot, which only has one lower down on the boot.

The boot has a **7 ½ inch shaft**, comparable to Northside’s 8 inch. The boot is made from a durable synthetic snow proof upper material. The inside has a faux **woolen/fur lining** providing a cozy feel. The sole is also synthetic and provides texture and slip resistance. I personally prefer TPR or rubber bottoms, but this is still a great option.

#### Pros of Apakowa Winter boots

<OutlineBox>
  * Double velcro hook and loop closure for easier on and off
  * Warm fuzzy lining
  * Textured and slip proof bottom design

#### Cons of Apakowa Winter boots

## Best Toddler Winter Socks Overview

My main goal as a mom of toddlers in winter is to make sure my kids are warm enough outside. That includes making sure they have the best warm socks for toddler to keep those feet warm. 

![daughter in best warm winter socks for toddlers and warm winter snow boots in the snow](http://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1725581838/toddler_in_snowsuit_hailey_bmimk0.jpg)

I love being outside with my toddlers in all the seasons. Winter is a great time for hiking and playing in snow and I want to make sure I am dressing them well to achieve that goal. That means keeping their feet warm and dry in winter socks.

The best winter socks for toddlers are made out of merino wool. Merino wool has a finer fiber making them even softer and warmer than traditional wool, however comes with a higher price tag. 

### Other Benefits of Merino Wool for Socks

<OutlineBox>
  * Absorbing capabilities
  * Odor-resistant
  * Keeps feet dry while insulating heat
  * Lightweight
  * Elasticity that allows for stretch but returns to original shape
</OutlineBox>

If price is a concern a combination of wool and other materials will make a more reasonably priced sock than a 100% merino wool sock.

### Things to Consider When Buying a Toddler Winter Sock

* **Material of the sock**
* **Height of the sock** - too high a sock impractical for a toddler to put on, but a sock too short might cause blister with boots or not warm the foot leg enough

The socks are made of **55% wool**, 25% cotton, 15% polyester and 5% spandex. All material used is **eco friendly** and non toxic. My toddlers and I don't find them itchy at all, but rather soft to the touch and do great at keeping kids' feet warm and toasty.

We use these socks under their snow boots as well as on cold days. The socks are thick so if your toddlers shoes are a snug fit you might have an issue, but I tend to get winter shoes/boots with extra room.

The socks come up a **couple inches above the ankles**, a bit lower than the Meriwool Merino socks. I personally have no issues with the height of the socks, it more than covers the gap of where the pants fall and the shoes start on too small clothes.

#### Pros of Antsang Kids Wool Hiking Socks:

<OutlineBox>
  * Cannot beat the price for 6 pairs
  * Eco friendly and non toxic material used
  * Over 50% wool
  * Soft non-itchy feel
  * Lots of design choice
  * Keeps feet warm and dry
</OutlineBox>

#### Cons of Antsang Kids Wool Hiking Socks

* Not as soft as merino wool
* You will want a longer sock if using for skiing

If you are planning on [skiing with your toddler](https://allaboutmomma.com/Skiing-with-Young-Kids-Beginners-Guide) this winter than you will want a perfect ski sock for toddlers. For every ski trip with my young kids I have them wear OutdoorMaster Ski Socks. They are made from merino wool blend making them moisture wicking and warm.

The ski sock for toddler is designed to go over the calf, which means your toddler's ski boot will fall below the socks leaving no room for your toddler's boot to rub on their skin. It has non-slip cuff that keeps the sock up and made to last.

My boys wore these socks when learning to ski and I loved them. Right length and stayed up on their calves, even with two boys running on the skinnier side. 

#### Pros of OutdoorMaster Kids Ski Sock:

<OutlineBox>
  * Merino Wool Blend
  * Over Calf Design
  * Non-slip Cuff
  * Machine Washable
  * Keeps feet warm and dry when on the slopes
  * Comes in many colors and cool designs (mountains)
</OutlineBox>

#### Cons of OutdoorMaster Kids Ski Sock:

* Only comes in mountain design
* Toddler might want to wear them all the time!

Overall it is very important what you put on your toddlers feet whether it be snow boots or warm winter socks to play in the snow. Your goal is to keep those feet dry and give your toddler a chance to fall in love with snow. 

I hope you found this helpful. Let me know if you have any questions!
