Gifford Pinchot State Park is located in northern York County just outside of Harrisburg. It is a popular place to fish, hike or spend some time out on a boat. It also features a disc golf course and horseback riding trails. The park has a lot to offer families visiting, especially if you live nearby.

I had a great time here with my three kids, husband and brother in law staying in a modern cabin, but I will admit it isn’t my favorite PA State Park and not one we plan on visiting again. The beach area isn’t as pristine as other state parks, lots of geese visit the beach and leave their mark. However, the park land around the beach is gorgeous and family friendly.

With that being said my kids didn’t seem to be bothered by it and had a great time at the beach area trying to “catch fish with their hands”. Standing in the water you can look down and see the fish swimming around you and this was a main attraction for my 5 year old. 

This park does a great job of offering many free activities to take part in when staying at the park or if you are visiting for the day. The activities change each week and I would suggest you check out the website ahead of time or stop in at the park office to see the schedule. Options when we were there were scavenger hunts, guided hikes and a woodpecker wander.

## Facts about Gifford Pinchot State Park

Size: 2,338 Acres

Playground: Yes

Hiking: 18 miles of trails

## Where to Stay at Gifford Pinchot State Park

[Gifford Pinchot State Park](https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateParks/FindAPark/GiffordPinchotStatePark/Pages/default.aspx) has several different options to stay overnight. It has one of the largest campsites in Pennsylvania with 289 different camping spots, ranging from some of which are designed for full RV hookups (electric, sewer and water) to basic tent sites. There are shower houses for the toilet and warm showers.

Pets are allowed on some campsites, however we didn’t bring our dog on this trip.

Besides camping Gifford Pinchot offers 10 modern cabins, 3 camping cottages and 2 yurts. The modern cabins feature their own restroom and running water while the other two options have restrooms close by for use. 

This was our first time trying out the modern cabins in the Pennsylvania state parks and I was pleasantly surprised. The prices were more than the rustic cabins I stayed in at [Worlds End](https://allaboutmomma.com/Worlds-End-State-Park-Family-Review), Tuscarora, [Ohiopyle](https://allaboutmomma.com/Ohiopyle-State-Park-Review-with-Kids) and [Ricketts Glen State Parks](https://allaboutmomma.com/Ricketts-Glen-State-Park-Review-with-Kids), but they were still reasonable and cheaper than hotel costs with the perk of staying  in a state park surrounded by nature.

### Modern Cabin Experience at Gifford Pinchot State Park with Kids

![Modern cabin at Gifford Pinchot State Park PA](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1723580227/gifford_pinchot_state_park_cabins_gsmaap.jpg "Our Modern Cabin for 3 Nights")

As mentioned this is the first time I stayed in the modern cabin option at PA state parks. I was pleasantly surprised by the look and feel of the cabin. The cabin had two bedrooms, one bedroom with two bunk beds and one bedroom with a double bed. There was a bathroom with a shower, a kitchen and sitting area.

The cabin had air conditioning, something I haven’t gotten before, as well as a sink in the kitchen with running water. This made the trip feel less like camping and more like renting an Airbnb, but out in nature.

The cabin had a covered porch with a picnic table and a fire pit. Every night we sat around the fire pit and roasted hot dogs and S’mores and enjoyed ourselves. When dinner was done it was easy to clean up and get the kids ready for bed. The running water makes it much easier to stay in the park when traveling with kids.

## Packing for Gifford Pinchot State Park

This will depend on what type of camping you are planning to do; tent camping, bringing your RV or staying in the park cabins.

### What to Pack to Stay in the Cabins

None of the cabins, including modern cabins, are stocked with linens or cookware so you will need to plan all the basics. 

* Cookware: A Camping cookware set is what I bring and it works great
* Plates and silverware: plastic sets work great 
* Sheets and Pillows: cabins come bare

### Hiking Gear

Hiking is an option at Gifford Pinchot State Park and there are trails you can access right from the modern cabins or camp sites, but there are others you can drive to depending on where you want to hike and where you are staying. Check out [hiking with babies](https://allaboutmomma.com/hiking-with-you-baby-0-6-months) or [hiking with toddlers](https://allaboutmomma.com/equipment-needed-to-hike-with-your-toddler) for a complete guide on hiking with children.

### Water Gear

Gifford Pinchot State Park has a beach area where the kids can go swimming. Rangers test the water frequently and sometimes the beach is closed due to water quality. Check the state website before your travel to see if the beach is open for your trip.

If the beach is open plan on bringing swim suits, water sandals (like Keen Newport H2 sandals which are also great for hiking), [swim vest](https://allaboutmomma.com/best-toddler-swim-vest-for-1-2-3-and-4-year-old) if you have toddlers who don't know how to swim yet, and swimming towels.

* Bikes: This park has a lot of mountain biking trails that are awesome. If your kid knows how to ride a bike bring it along. My younger two (ages 2 and 4) rode Strider Bikes, 12x Sport and 14x with peddle conversion. My 5 year old is riding a Belsize 16x that I highly recommend.
* Kids Camera: Kids love to copy what adults do and on trips I take a lot of pictures. My children also love to document their adventures in their own way.

## What To Do At Gifford Pinchot State Park with Kids

The top things to do with kids are:

1. Swim and use playground at Gifford Pinchot State Park Beach 
2. Rent a Boat to canoe or kayak around Pinchot Lake
3. Hike the Trails: Lakeside Trail our favorite with kids
4. Go Fishing
5. Try out the Disc Golf Course
6. Go back in time and get ice cream at Forry’s Drive-In

### Beach area of Gifford Pinchot State Park

The beach area is not like a typical sand lake beach, but rather park land that butts up to water. The park ground is nicely kept, with a playground, grills and plenty of picnic tables to set up at. 

There is a large facility building for a restroom room, changing area and a snack pavilion. The snack stand is only open in the summer months. When we were visiting the area was under construction, they were updating it to include more eco friendly features like solar panels and charging stations. 

![playground at gifford pinchot state park beach area](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1723580286/gifford_pinchot_state_park_playground_hpl75y.jpg "Playground is part of beach area")

My kids had a great time at the playground and enjoyed trying to fish with their hands in the water. I didn’t love the sand beach area for two reasons. The first is It was very small, only a sliver of sand before the water and the second reason is that it had too much goose poop you had to step over. My kids didn’t mind, but it did put me off.

If you are camping there is a nicer beach area with sand close to the campgrounds. I won’t say it is free of goose poop, but much better and has a lot more sand.

![second beach at gifford pinchot state park good for kids](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1723580263/gifford_pinchot_state_park_beach_campground_ztdjro.jpg "Nice Beach Area next to campgrounds")

### Boat Rentals on Lake Pinchot

The large lake gave us the opportunity to rent a boat of our choosing, a kayak, row or paddle boat. We chose a kayak and a rowboat, since we had such a large group, 3 adults and 3 kids.

![boat rental at gifford pinchot state park pa](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1723580273/gifford_pinchot_state_park_lake_a8oimd.jpg "Our group renting boats")

It was nice to get out on the lake and for us adults it was challenging to steer a rowboat! The rental charges per hour so we only paid for an hour thinking that if it went well we could stay out longer and pay the difference at our return.   Unfortunately, our youngest, a newly 2 year old, wasn’t loving the water so we only stayed out for the hour with her.

The boat rental has all different sized life jacket so do not worry if you didn't bring your own.

### Hiking Trails at Gifford Pinchot State Park with Kids

The park has a great network of trails that are well suited to little people. Right outside our modern cabin was the Lakeside Trail that took us along the lake to the beach area, a little less than a mile. My kids were happy to hike this trail, or bike a couple times, to get to the water and playground. 

![hiking trails at gifford pinchot state park things to do with kids](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1723580251/gifford_pinchot_bike_riding_kids_zrgezc.jpg "Trails were bike friendly")

You could have also continued that trail around the whole lake. A couple mornings this was the trail I used to go for a run and found the trail easy to run on. 

On the other side of the lake from the modern cabins is where the campground is and and there are more hiking trails. Most of the trails on this side are mountain bike friendly and my kids were happy to take a ride on the terrain.

This park is fun to hike and use kids bikes to try out riding on trails, but not my favorite hiking in state parks. I was content hiking these trails for a couple of days, but would struggle to stay a full week.

### Go Fishing

Every day we walked past people fishing on the piers or boats around the lake. I have never fished before and my children have only fished with grandparents, but it seems if you are a family that likes fishing this could be a good spot for it.

![fishing at gifford pinchot state park pa: things to do with kids](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1723580296/gifford_pinchot_lake_lucas_uyoade.jpg "Son trying to catch a fish bare handed")

Although we aren’t fishers my sons had no trouble getting in the spirit and trying to catch one bare handed. They would stand very still in the water until they saw a fish and quickly tried to grab one. The waters were covered in fish, however my sons were unsuccessful.

### Try out the Disc Golf Course

I once would have thought disc golf would definitely not be an activity we partake in as a family, but never say never. My brother started playing several years back and got my husband and kids into it. Now, although I don't love the sport, I find it a fun activity to do as a family.

I mean it is sort of like hiking. You get to walk through beautiful combed park land. It is just you throw a disc around as you do so. It is a great way to get the kids energy out and partake in something as a family.

You only need a [couple starter discs](https://www.amazon.com/Dynamic-Starter-Escape-Fairway-Midrange/dp/B07NGLX67H?crid=9TWFIP964P0B\&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.2OHvpxBgw0VK6jUHbebTeo9cutBv25qck8sCRrCV-RyvreLp7YLJqdwDFeki77ZK_-8UPR5Z3DY4E14uLjfoAvauTmOs3YV2CurcTO3teh2c1q6m3o0ZdrApGhHtl4Clz1pNTNIyZjvOkzfKCbCDytHJe818HWbhuC1-HDBxsR7kIOb_JSmH3Gvej82SsRxIQUg0v9YkegoL3cXm7bj6hosXFsuwgQ3itncvtwaO7X22-Khs6PfBMSxj4qBF4lLyrm53luX1HV_ksgFvr7YXNibNdRcDOycD1vqbc34cx2Q.p-IzZ1eV2MKqxDZU-TYsSlqIubUPdNLXs3GPyWkn5kI\&dib_tag=se\&keywords=starter+disc+golf+set+for+kids\&qid=1723595735\&sprefix=starter+disc+golf+set+for+kids%2Caps%2C93\&sr=8-1-spons\&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY\&psc=1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=e99839ad8566e8d10acc2f08ee369d4f\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) to start and it is free to play at most courses.

### Travel Back in Time and Enjoy Ice-Cream at Forry’s Drive In

On the south side of the park just outside is Forry’s Drive In, a classic 1950’s style ice cream and quick food option. It is located on a hill with a great view of the surrounding area with an old tractor for the kids to hop up on.

The ice cream is soft serve with some mix in, but affordable and large portions. No one in our party finished our ice-creams, and not for lack of wanting to. 

## Family Friendly Places Around Gifford Pinchot State Park

On the south side of the park on Carlisle Road is the Pinchot General Store. This was a great location if you needed anything for your trip, they had a little bit of everything. I needed marshmallows, bug spray and milk and that wasn’t a problem.

Next to the General Store is an Italian restaurant, a great choice if you wanted to go out for a meal while staying at the park, or get pizza to take back to your campsite or cabin.

Finally if you are looking for more breakfast or lunch you could try Ray’s, it is located catty corner to the General Store.

## Final Thoughts on Gifford Pinchot State Park with Kids

This park wasn’t my favorite state park to visit, mainly due to being disappointed by the lack of sand beach and goose poop. Putting that aside, my kids had a great time and I enjoyed the modern cabins and free programs the park offered.

If you are local to the area it is worth it to check out the park with kids, but plan on spending less time at the beach and more time either fishing, disc golf, hiking or trying out the kids bikes on the trails.

I would recommend only staying a couple days at this state park, perhaps a weekend. If you have longer to spend I would recommend checking out some of the other state parks in PA.
