There is nothing better than enjoying an activity you love with your baby or toddler. For me that is taking my toddler on bike rides with me using a child bike seat. To make that feasible I needed the perfect baby bike seat for our bikes so I could continue to cycle. 

![best toddler bike seat](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975366/cycle-with-a-toddler-two-toddlers.jpg "My two boys on a bike ride to the park")

Currently, we take our two toddler boys frequently on the bike. My youngest is almost 2 and asks to go on a bike ride almost daily now. My 3.5 year old is more than happy to go along with that idea.

## **When Can a Baby Start Riding in a Bike Seat?**

Babies need to acquire the right head strength before being able to ride on your bike. A baby needs proper neck control for any ride to be safe for a baby. The **[American Academy of Pediatrics](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/at-play/Pages/Baby-On-Board-Keeping-Safe-On-A-Bike.aspx?_ga=2.164784124.2125444770.1643850444-542754774.1643850444&_gl=1*i1p6cg*_ga*NTQyNzU0Nzc0LjE2NDM4NTA0NDQ.*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*MTY0Mzg1MDQ0My4xLjEuMTY0Mzg1MDQ2Mi4w)** advises that you should wait till your baby is **12 months old**.

If you have any concerns you should speak to your pediatrician before taking your baby on your bike with you.

![bike riding with my 3 year old toddler](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975366/best-child-bike-seat-5.jpg "My almost 3 year old loving his bike ride")

I personally have waited till both my boys were 12 months old before putting them on my bike. Both my boys immediately fell in love with going on bike rides with both myself and my husband. I **[cycled through all my pregnancies](/can-pregnant-women-ride-bikes)** with or without kids on the back!

## What Are the **Different Bike Seat Options**?

There are 3 different locations where you can place a child bike seat on your bike; **front mounted, rear mounted and a mid-mount bike seat**. Each has its own pros and cons that I will take you through.

### _Front Mounted Baby Bike Seat_: 

The front mounted baby bike seat mounts to the stem of an adult bike, below the handlebars. Front baby bicycle seats are designed for babies and young toddlers, normally having a child weight limit of 33lbs or 3 years old. 

These seats allow for best balancing and closer contact with your baby or young toddler. You will be able to touch and communicate with your child as you cycle.

However, these bike seats provide the shortest use and can limit steering ability. Front mounted baby bike seats are not compatible with all types of bikes, for instance bikes with drop handlebars might not have remove on the stem to mount the front bike seat to.

#### Features of Front Mounted Baby and Toddler Seats

- **Back Height**: The higher the back of the front mounted seat the safer the seat is for a baby/ young toddler. 

- **Adjustable Footrest**: Ability to secure your baby or young toddler’s feet to the footrest

- **Shock absorbency**: Whether the seat has any shock-absorbing qualities.

- **Harness type**: Whether the harness is 3 or 5 point, the comfort of the harness, padded vs non-padded and the adjustability of the harness

#### Pros of Front Mounted Child Bike Seats

- Close contact with child

- Ability to talk to child

- Best stability while riding

#### Cons of Front Mounted Child Bike Seats

- Shortest use: only suitable for a baby and young toddler

- Can limit steering range

- Not compatible with drop handlebar bikes

### _Rear Mounted Baby and Toddler Bike Seat_

The rear mounted baby and toddler bike seat have two locations the seat can mount to; either the frame of the bike or to a bike rack. Each rear child bike seat is different and you want to ensure your bike is suitable for the type of seat you buy. 

![Back rear mounted child bike seat](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975367/two-bikes-with-bike-carrier-attached.jpg "My Back Rack Mounted Bike Set Up")

Rear Mounted child seats provide longer duration than a front mounted seat, typically weight limit between 40 and 50 lbs or a 6 year old. These rear child seats have the most features available and will be the most comfortable for your toddler or child. 

Rear mounted child bike seats offer less stability than the front mounted seats, however they provide better steering control. You can use a child seat as soon as your baby is able to ride on a bike, illuminating the need for a front mounted seat followed by a rear seat.

#### Features of Rear Mounted Child Seats

- **Harness Type and Adjustability:** Harness: a 3 or 5 point harness, whether the straps are padded or not and adjustability up and down of the harness for the growing child.

- **Reclinability:** The ability of the seat to recline to provide more comfort for napping child

- **Weight Limit**: The maximum weight limit for the seat

- **Shock Absorbency**: Ability of the seat to smooth out the toddler/child’s ride

- **Footrest Adjustability**: Ability of footrest to grow with child and keep feet secure

#### Pros of Back Mounted Bike Seats

- Longevity of use: 1-6 year old

- More features for optimum child comfort

- Two ways to mount to accommodate different bike styles

#### Cons of Back Mounted Bike Seats

- Time for adult to adjust to different stability of the bike

- Less easy to communicate with child

### _Mid-mount child bike seat_ 

A mid-mount child bike seat is a child seat placed **in between the adult seat and the handlebars**. These seats are designed for mountain bikes and for an older child; no harness is provided. The adults arms go around the child keeping them in place.

The mid-mount child bike seat keeps the child's weight in the middle of the bike helping maintain bike stability. These child bike seats allow for you to take your child off road and explore mountain biking, just be sure your child is old enough to hold on.

I personally am not a mountain biker so I have not used this set up. However, I do know a couple mountain bikers who love the mid-mounted bike seat for their mountain biking adventures with their child.

#### Pros of Mid-Mount Mounted Child Bike Seats

- Very stable for rider

- Ability to take child on mountain biking trails

- Fits most mountain bikes

#### Cons of Mid-Mount Child Bike Seats

- No safety harness is provided

- Only recommended for older child- not babies and young toddlers

## How to Install a Front Mounted Bicycle Seat

A front mounted bicycle seat requires space on the stem of the handlebars. The height and width of the stem will determine if the front mounted baby seat will fit.

![long stem for front mounted bicycle seat](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975368/long-tube-for-front-mounting-bike-seat.jpg "This Trek Bike has a long stem that would be a good fit for a front mounted bicycle seat")

A bike with drop handle bars often **Does Not** have space on the stem for a front mounted bicycle seat.

![no stem room for font mounted bike seat to fit](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975369/no-front-mount-available.jpg "This bike doesn't have room on the stem to attach a front mounted bike seat")

Each baby bike seat has different requirements. Check the requirements before purchasing and ensure your bike can acomodate.

Not only is it competitively priced, but it also has all the design features for a safe and comfortable ride for your child. 

![best toddler bike seat ](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975369/best-child-bike-seat-3.jpg "My toddlers loving their Hamax seats and bike accessories!")

The Hamax Caress has won multiple awards for its product design and innovation and offers a 3 year warranty. The rear child bike seat offers two different ways to mount to a bike; either by a bike rack or directly to the frame. 

The back bike seat can be used for a child from 1 year to 6 years olds or 48.5 lbs, making it the longest duration rear back seat. Hamax can offer this with its very adjustable bike seat to ensure it grows with your toddler/child. 

It is the only bike seat that has an anti lock bracket lock and non-slip shoulder straps. It has an ultra shock absorbing suspicion built in to ensure a smooth ride feel for your child.

This is the bike seat my husband and I use for our toddlers/kids. My toddlers have taken naps comfortably in this seat and we have never had any concerns. Sometimes they fall asleep before I even recline the seat back. My kids ask again and again to go on a bike ride and say the seat is very comfortable.

### Thule RideAlong Child Bike Seat: Runner Up Best Overall Toddler and Child Rear Mounted Bike Seat

<AffiliateLink button={true} image="" affiliateURLs={{ imageURL: "//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01E9T76CW&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&language=en_US" , linkURL:"https://www.amazon.com/Thule-Childrens-RideAlong-Bike-Light/dp/B01E9T76CW?keywords=thule+ridealong+child+bike+seat&qid=1650240139&sprefix=thule+ridealong+child+b%2Caps%2C70&sr=8-5&linkCode=li2&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=13df372c8d1ff853261f7157562f0fa8&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" }} />

The main reason I prefer the Hamax over the Thule is the Thule is priced higher, has a lower maximum weight capacity by 8.5 lbs and cannot be mounted onto a bike rack.

Like the Hamax the Thule is fully adjustable and able to grow with your child. The company offers a 5 year warranty on the seat and it fits both round and oval frames. The Thule RideAlong comes with a back reflector that the Hamax does not have.

Your child will ride in comfort with its Shock-absorbant dual Beam Suspension and removable washable padding. Friends I know that use this bike carrier for their toddler have had their toddlers fall asleep on longer rides with its reclinability option.

#### Main Features of Thule RideAlong Child Bike Seat

- Harness Type: 3 point harness; padded shoulder straps

- Max Rider Weight: 40 lbs

- Shock-absorption DualBeam Suspension

- Adjustable footrests

- Mount Type: Back frame mount (Round Frame 27.2-40mm, oval frame 40-55mm)

### Burley Dash Child Bike Seat: Best Budget Child and Toddler Rear Mounted Bike Seat

**[Burley Dash Child Bike Seat](https://www.amazon.com/Burley-Dash-Child-Black-924001/dp/B083YMJ7GN?crid=2ZDXP1UCWULQY&keywords=burley+dash+child+bike+seat&qid=1650240193&sprefix=burley+dash+child+bike+seat%2Caps%2C69&sr=8-5&linkCode=ll1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=991caf50a0dc3e44cc0e5473eed24699&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** is a great budget friendly choice. The rear toddler seat is the only one with a 5 point harness that has padded shoulder straps and a rear storage compartment. For a rider not anticipating long bike rides and more local trips this could be the perfect fit.

The rear child bike seat is adjustable, although not as much as the Thule or Hamax. For 30 dollars more you can buy the frame mounted reclining option, otherwise the seat doesn’t recline.

The biggest difference in Burley Dash seats compared to more expensive brands is the shock absorption. This seat doesn’t offer it, making the child’s ride more bumpy. Also without buying the more expensive reclining option, your child will most likely not want to take a nap in this seat.

#### Main Features of Burley Dash Child Bike Seat

- Harness Type: Adjustable 5 point harness system; padded shoulder straps

- Max Rider Weight: 40 lbs

- Adjustable footrests: 4 positions 

- Mount Type: back rack or frame mount option

- Product Weight: 9.05

- Product Material: Alloy Steel

- Reclinability: Frame mount comes with 20 degree recline for additional money

Bellelli is another solid choice for a budget friendly rear child bike seat. It is cheaper than Burley Dash, however a level down in comfort. 

The **[Bellelli Child Bike Seat](https://www.amazon.com/Bellelli-Child-Carrier-Bikes-Bicycle/dp/B07XJZM71T?crid=2D0CGCNWX2EY&keywords=bellelli+child+bike+seat&qid=1650240254&sprefix=bellelli+child+bike+seat%2Caps%2C66&sr=8-5&linkCode=ll1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=e892ac84fcb25418045c8636e2387210&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** shoulder straps are not padded and the seat is built with minimum added padding. The seat features lots of ventilation holes, so it could be perfect if you live in a hot climate.

The seat has a higher mx weight limit of 48.5 compared to only 40 for the Burley Dash. If you are looking for a budget rear bike seat for your child for trips around town and not all day riding this seat is a great option.

#### Main Features of Bellelli Child Bike Seat

This seat is designed as a cocoon seat with padding around. The seat comes with the rear rack and cannot be mounted on the frame. It comes with a 2 year manufacturer guarantee.

The seat has a rear reflector and a 3 point harness. The seat is adjustable to grow with your child and dual steel spring suspension for a more comfortable ride. The biggest flaw is the Topeak Babyseat has no option to recline and is not as adjustable as Hamax or Thule.

The Topeak Babyseat comes with a padded hand rest for your child. My neighbor has this bike rear seat and their toddler has no complaints riding along.  However, they do not do road cycling; they take more family friendly short rides.

#### Main Features of Topeak Babyseat:

- Harness Type: 3 point harness; non padded straps

- Max Rider Weight: 48.5 lbs

- Built in Suspension

- Adjustable footrests and straps

## How to Install a Rear Mounted Bicycle Seat

Rear Mounted Bicycle Seats often have two options to install; mounted onto the frame/seat post or a rack.

![back rear mount options explained](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975371/bike-seat-mount-explained-1.jpg "Bike Can Accept Rack Mount (eyelets available) but not Frame Mount due to External Cables")

Bike Can Accept Rack Mount (eyelets available) but not Frame Mount due to External Cables

### Rack Mount Tips:

Rack Mounted Seats are normally the **easiest to install,** but require your bike to attach a rack to your bike. Not all bikes will have the right clearance for a bike rack. Carbon fiber bikes often do not!

![Eyelets on bike for back rack](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975371/eyelet-on-bike.jpg "Above bike can accept a rack, it has eyelets")

In order to install a rear rack on your bike your bike **must have eyelets to mount the rack**. Check this on your bike before buying a rack mounted rear child bike seat.

![no Eyelet on bike](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975371/no-eyelets-on-bike.jpg "This Bike has NO eyelet so cannot accept a back rack mounted bike seat")

Also not all racks are **compatible with disc-brake bikes.** Make sure you research which rack to buy if you plan on mounting a bike seat via a bike rack.

Check that the rack you use has a weigh capacity greater than the bike seat plus child weight.

### Frame Mount Tips:

Frame mounted seats connect via your seat tube. Check the bike seat you are to purchase for the range of **acceptable tube length and thickness** before purchasing a frame mounted seat.

If your bike has a rear external brake cable a rear frame won't work. A bike with its cables inside the bike tube works best.

Lastly, is the **gap between the seat and the frame.** Most rear frame options need at least 2.25 inches clearance to work.
