The Pocono Mountains, located just a short drive from Bucks County, offer great family friendly-skiing and snowboarding experiences in Pennsylvania. With beautiful landscapes, a range of slope difficulties, and family-friendly amenities, the Poconos are a fantastic winter getaway for families with kids. 

The Poconos is great for families with young kids that are learning to ski. With some great options of bunny hills, magic carpets and lessons for kids. My kids have learned to ski in the Poconos and would highly recommend it. 

Of course there are more dramatic mountains in the US out west or further north in the north east, but hear me out. Kids, who are still learning, don’t need the biggest mountain or the longest slopes, they need practice and easy slopes. The Pocono mountains are perfect for that and more reasonably priced than other ski areas in the USA.

Below you will find my 6 different family friendly ski resorts in the Poconos PA.

## Shawnee Mountain Ski Area – East Stroudsburg, PA

Perfect for families with young kids or toddlers

Shawnee Mountain is a smaller, family-oriented resort that is perfect for beginner and intermediate skiers. With 23 trails and two terrain parks, Shawnee offers a less crowded, more laid-back atmosphere than some of the larger resorts. The mountain's gentle slopes and wide-open trails are ideal for families with young children or first-time skiers.

Shawnee’s SKIwee program is designed specifically for kids aged 4-6, offering ski lessons in a fun and supportive environment. Both my boys started in the SKIwee program and graduated in a day. The ski instructors knew exactly how to coach a new skier and made my boys fall in love with skiing.

Once your child has graduated from Skiwee program they can enroll in the next level up, Mountain Cruisers. This is a 3 hour half day program or full day that starts on the bunny hill and depending on skill level go further up the mountain. This is a great opportunity for parents to go ski, as I do!

All kids ski programs include rentals and lift tickets in pricing.

The resort also has a snow tubing park for families looking to take a break from skiing and enjoy some extra winter fun.

Shawnee Mountain does not have accommodation on site, but there are some options in the nearby area. My favorite overnight accommodation is Shawnee Inn and Golf Resort. This is a 5 minute drive away and a great place for families. The Shawnee Inn has bonfires every night and provide S’more ingredients.

#### Why it's great for families:

* Smaller, more relaxed atmosphere
* Excellent ski programs for young children
* Family-friendly snow tubing
* More affordable lift tickets and packages

## Jack Frost Big Boulder – Blakeslee, PA

Great for families with mixed ages or older kids

Jack Frost Big Boulder is actually two ski areas in one, offering diverse experiences for families. Jack Frost is better suited for beginners and families with kids, featuring 20 trails with wide, gentle runs that are perfect for learning. For more advanced family members, Big Boulder offers steeper terrain and challenging runs. It has 19 trails. 

Both mountains offer ski and snowboarding school for kids aged 4-12. The group lessons are 2 hours long and do not include lift tickets or equipment rentals, but can be purchased for a discounted rate when booking lessons.

Families can also enjoy snow tubing at Jack Frost, which has multiple lanes and a magic carpet for easy access to the top of the hill.

Although there is no accommodation on the resort there are several attractive options nearby. One of the most popular choices is Split Rock Resort, which sits between Jack Frost and Big Boulder. Split Rock Resort features an indoor waterpark, 8 lane bowling alley, arace and movie theater. 

#### Why it's great for families:

* Two mountains in one: Jack Frost for beginners, Big Boulder for more advanced skiers

## Blue Mountain Resort – Palmerton, PA

Blue Mountain Resort is one of the largest ski resorts in Pennsylvania, offering 40 trails and five terrain parks. With the highest vertical drop in the state, it provides a thrilling experience for skiers and snowboarders of all levels. While Blue Mountain has plenty of challenging runs for advanced skiers, it also caters to families with a variety of beginner and intermediate slopes.

In my opinion this is the best option for families with older kids or kids who have been skiing for several years. 

For families new to skiing, Blue Mountain’s explorers lessons offers kids aged 4 to 13 a 1.5 hour group lesson. These lessons include rentals and lift passes. It can be booked for beginners up to more advanced skill levels. 

 Blue Mountain is also home to the region’s longest and fastest snow tubing lanes, making it a favorite for non-skiing family members.

Blue Mountain doesn’t offer accommodation on the mountain, but you can find local hotels or airbnb to stay at. If you are being adventurous you can book a campsite!

#### Why it's great for families:

* Excellent range of trails for all skill levels
* Comprehensive ski and snowboard lessons
* Long, exciting snow tubing lanes
* Plenty of dining and relaxation options at the base

The mountain features 18 trails, mostly designed for beginner and intermediate skiers. The resort is known for its welcoming atmosphere and is ideal for families just starting out with skiing or snowboarding.

Ski Big Bear also offers affordable lift tickets, making it a budget-friendly option for families. Their Learn-to-Ski program is for kids 6 and older who have never been on skis before. If they have been skiing before and 4 years or older you can purchase a private 1 hour lesson. Lessons cannot be booked online but you can call to reserve a day ahead of time.

Big Bear doesn’t have accommodations on site, but does recommend Woodloch Pines Resort, located 6 miles away. Woodlock Pines Resort has been awarded “Best Inclusive Family Resorts”.

## What is the Best Ski Resort for Families with Younger Kids or Toddlers?

I personally love Shawnee Mountain for families with young kids. The ski program offers great rates which include lift tickets and rentals and a longer program. The three hour mountain cruisers can be booked once a young child passes Skiwee, which was achievable for my 4 year old. 

Think about it, your child is in ski lessons for 3 hours. Adults can go ski during that time and come together to ski some more later. For me a mix of family skiing and a lesson for my child are the winning ticket.

## What is the Best Ski Resort for Families with Older Kids?

Camelback and Jack Frost Big Boulder have the most to offer families with older kids. The larger mountains provide more skiing options. Lessons are still available and night skiing options provide a longer ski window. Both resorts have snow tubing options to add on the fun.

Camelback is a great pick for families staying a couple days with their option to stay on the mountain. With their slopes, tubing and indoor water park kids will not be bored.

## Tips for Family Skiing in the Poconos:

* Book early: Ski resorts in the Poconos are popular, so book accommodations and lift tickets early to secure the best deals.
* Dress in layers: Weather in the mountains can change quickly, so make sure to bring layers to stay warm.
* Read Full Details: Some ski resorts offer free lift tickets to kids under certain heights or age. Some ski schools prices include rentals and lift passes and some do not.
* Take breaks: Skiing can be tiring for kids, so plan for plenty of rest breaks at the lodge or on the tubing hill.
* Check for family deals: Many resorts offer family-friendly packages, including discounted lift tickets, lessons, and rentals.

## Conclusion: Winter Fun for the Whole Family

The Pocono Mountains offer a fantastic array of ski resorts that cater to families looking for a winter getaway. With plenty of beginner-friendly slopes, excellent ski schools, and fun activities like snow tubing, these resorts make it easy for everyone in the family to enjoy the snow. 

Whether you have younger kids or older kids there is a Pocono mountain ski resort for your family.
