The Pocono Mountains, located just a short drive from Bucks County, offer great family friendly-skiing and snowboarding experiences in Pennsylvania. With beautiful landscapes, a range of slope difficulties, and family-friendly amenities, the Poconos are a fantastic winter getaway for families with kids.

The Poconos is great for families with young kids that are learning to ski. With some great options of bunny hills, magic carpets and lessons for kids. My kids have learned to ski in the Poconos and would highly recommend it. Read [Skiing with Young Kids](https://allaboutmomma.com/Skiing-with-Young-Kids-Beginners-Guide) for a guide about skiing with kids.

Of course there are more dramatic mountains in the US out west or further north in the north east, but hear me out. Kids, who are still learning, don’t need the biggest mountain or the longest slopes, they need practice and easy slopes. The Pocono mountains are perfect for that and more reasonably priced than other ski areas in the USA.

Below you will find my 6 different family friendly ski resorts in the Poconos PA.

## Shawnee Mountain Ski Area – East Stroudsburg, PA

Perfect for families with young kids or toddlers

[Shawnee Mountain](https://shawneemt.com/) is a smaller, family-oriented resort that is perfect for beginner and intermediate skiers. With 23 trails and two terrain parks, Shawnee offers a less crowded, more laid-back atmosphere than some of the larger resorts. The mountain's gentle slopes and wide-open trails are ideal for families with young children or first-time skiers.

![5 year old on top of the bunny hill Shawnee Mountain](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1718820052/lucas_at_top_of_bunny_hill_lmpkkd.jpg "My 5 Year Old at the top of the bunny hill")

Shawnee’s SKIwee program is designed specifically for kids aged 4-6, offering ski lessons in a fun and supportive environment. Both my boys started in the SKIwee program and graduated in a day. The ski instructors knew exactly how to coach a new skier and made my boys fall in love with skiing.

Once your child has graduated from Skiwee program they can enroll in the next level up, Mountain Cruisers. This is a 3 hour half day program or full day that starts on the bunny hill and depending on skill level go further up the mountain. This is a great opportunity for parents to go ski, as I do!

All kids ski programs include rentals and lift tickets in pricing.

The resort also has a snow tubing park for families looking to take a break from skiing and enjoy some extra winter fun.

With the highest vertical drop in the state, it provides a thrilling experience for skiers and snowboarders of all levels.

In my opinion this is the best option for families with older kids or kids who have been skiing for several years.

## What is the Best Ski Resort for Families with Younger Kids or Toddlers?

I personally love Shawnee Mountain for families with young kids. The ski program offers great rates which include lift tickets and rentals and a longer program. The three hour mountain cruisers can be booked once a young child passes Skiwee, which was achievable for my 4 year old. 

Think about it, your child is in ski lessons for 3 hours. Adults can go ski during that time and come together to ski some more later. For me a mix of family skiing and a lesson for my child are the winning ticket.

## What is the Best Ski Resort for Families with Older Kids?

Camelback and Jack Frost Big Boulder have the most to offer families with older kids. The larger mountains provide more skiing options. Lessons are still available and night skiing options provide a longer ski window. Both resorts have snow tubing options to add on the fun.

Camelback is a great pick for families staying a couple days with their option to stay on the mountain. With their slopes, tubing and indoor water park kids will not be bored.

## Tips for Family Skiing in the Poconos:

<OutlineBox>
  * Book early: Ski resorts in the Poconos are popular, so book accommodations and lift tickets early to secure the best deals.
  * **Dress in layers:** Weather in the mountains can change quickly, so make sure to bring layers to stay warm. Kids who get cold will get cranky quickly. Dress them in [snow outfits](https://allaboutmomma.com/best-snow-outfits-for-toddlers)! And have them wear [ski socks](https://allaboutmomma.com/best-toddler-snow-boots-and-winter-socks).
  * Read Full Details: Some ski resorts offer **free lift tickets to kids** under certain heights or age. Some ski schools prices include rentals and lift passes and some do not.
  * Take breaks: Skiing can be tiring for kids, so plan for plenty of rest breaks at the lodge or on the tubing hill.
  * Check for family deals: Many resorts offer family-friendly packages, including discounted lift tickets, lessons, and rentals.
