A travel high chair is an essential for families who are always on the go or, like my family, out hiking with babies. It is true that most restaurants, if not all, you go to will be able to provide you with a high chair or booster seat, but unless the only places you eat are restaurants, where lets be honest the high chair isn’t always the cleanest, and your own home a traveling high chair comes in handy. Also for any families traveling outside of the US high chairs at restaurants are less common.  

The biggest consideration when purchasing a traveling high chair is **your intended use**. Do you wish to use the traveling high chair only at people’s homes or also outside while on an adventure?

I use my traveling high chair while hiking or enjoying time with nature. To read more about hiking check out **[Hiking with a Toddler](/equipment-needed-to-hike-with-your-toddler)** or **[Hiking withe a Baby](/hiking-with-you-baby-0-6-months)** Guides.

I also have taken a traveling high chair on planes. To read my tips on traveling with toddlers on an airplane click [](/tips-for-flying-with-toddlers) **[here.](/tips-for-flying-with-toddlers)**

## **Best Hiking Friendly Travel High chair**

This is the traveling high chair my husband and I bought before our first major hiking trip with our, at the time, 10 month old Lucas. He was at the stage where we were feeding him purees and out hiking we wanted a reliable chair for him to sit and eat. We were going to the Rocky Mountain National Park and planned on embarking on multi hour hikes. I didn’t want to lose the traction we gained, so I began the search on traveling high chairs. 

For us we needed a portable high chair where we **didn’t need a real chair to strap it to,** since we were going to be using it in nature. Weight was a consideration because I didn’t want extra pounds weighing me down on the hikes. And it had to be compact-able.

We were sold on the Hiccapop Omniboost Travel Booster Seat and years later we are still using it and recommending it!

The **[Hiccapop](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078K1W9B3?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=d71426b0a899e09af1ed97529d943671&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** [](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078K1W9B3/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B078K1W9B3&linkCode=as2&tag=allaboutmomma-20&linkId=77a4e4dd98710df0bc86ba76ad169367) seat hit all of our requirements. Both of our kids use this chair when we need a place for them to sit and eat, whether or not we are out on the trails or even in our backyards. The chair can be placed on the ground or strapped to a chair.

The **carrying case** makes it simple to keep the chair and tray together and easy to swing over your shoulder or pack in a bag. 

When we aren’t hiking with the chair we often use this chair in our **backyard for barbecues**, at other people's homes or for sporting events. Our toddlers can easily get in and out themselves, when the tray isn’t attached, and it provides a convenient spot for them to enjoy a snack or just observe their surroundings.

Maybe you are not hikers and don’t foresee yourself needing a traveling high chair where you wouldn’t have access to a normal backed chair.

## **Other Notable Travel High Chairs**

### _Nuby Easy Go Safety Lightweight High Chair_

<AffiliateLink button={true} image="" affiliateURLs={{ imageURL: "//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B08Y6XLJQD&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&language=en_US" , linkURL:"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08Y6XLJQD?ie=UTF8&linkCode=li2&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=2022487515c16618711d25d2fc1182b6&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" }} />

This [**travel high chair**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08Y6XLJQD?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=367bcb8045676c010df684209faf7a3a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) comes in at **under two pounds** and compacts down making it easier for travel. The price is **slightly cheaper** than the previous two travel high chairs and comes in a **low-maintenance coated nylon** which wipes clean. This travel high chair straps to most chairs, at the bottom and top of the chair, allowing your little one to be secure with you at the table. 

Some people end up using this type of high chair for their everyday use enabling their baby/toddler to be more engaged at the table, instead of in a stand alone high chair seat. Both my toddlers **favor a booster travel chair** strapped to a chair rather than a traditional high chair. I was very happy when I got to ditch my traditional bulky high chair when my littlest was only 15 months old! 

If you don’t watch out you just might replace your high chair with this travel booster seat!

#### Pros of Nuby Easy Go Safety Lightweight High Chair:

#### Cons of Nuby Easy Go Safety Lightweight High Chair:

### _Fisher-Price Healthy Care Booster Seat_

<AffiliateLink button={true} image="" affiliateURLs={{ imageURL: "//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B014D4H754&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&language=en_US" , linkURL:"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014D4H754?ie=UTF8&linkCode=li2&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=1beb11f5c97c03f79422b3a6775fe4ab&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" }} />

The last seat I want to mention comes from the well known Fisher-Price family. This seat comes in right **at 2 lbs** and includes a **dishwashable tray**. The seat straps to a chair in two locations allowing a secure fit.

The seat is more bulky than the other seats, but does **fold in half** and comes with a strap to carry the seat over your shoulder. The chair comes with a dishwashable tray giving you the option to eat from the table or off their tray. 

This Fisher-Price [**seat**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014D4H754?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=40b5502f2f5416519eed8931b4cbde04&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) could be a good option if you want to **leave a portable high chair** at a grandparents house or  a house you visit frequently, but I personally wouldn’t be carrying it around on the go, unless only in the trunk of our car. You might also consider replacing your high chair with this seat. 

The brand is reliable and the seat is easier to clean than the Nuby. The straps are NOT white, which helps appear cleaner for longer; we know our toddlers can be messy!
