Keeping toddlers hydrated throughout the day is crucial for their health and well-being, especially on outside adventures.. One of the easiest and most convenient ways to encourage proper hydration is by letting your child have their own toddler water bottle.

My toddlers all love having their own water bottle just for them. A toddler will not want to share their water bottle, but will take full ownership of the water bottle. A fun way to encourage water drinking is to engage your toddler in the selection of their water bottle.

Toddler water bottles come in fun colors and designs that will capture your toddler. Or you can decorate a more basic design with sticks, just like my older toddlers have done.

## Considerations for the Perfect Toddler Water Bottle

Each toddler will have a different water bottle that is perfect for them at different stages of their development. All three of my kids, depending on their age and unique personality, have had a different bottle at different  points in time that worked best for them.

Below I go through the different considerations before selecting your ideal toddler water bottle.

### Age of Child:

Age of your child will matter. As you know your toddler is developing at an exponential speed and, just like clothes, will outgrow water bottles. The best water bottle for  a 2 year old will be different from the best water bottle for a 4 year old.

A younger toddler requires less fluids than an older toddler. So a smaller bottle for smaller hands works well for a 1 year old. Too big a bottle for a younger toddler might mean it is too heavy and cumbersome to drink by themselves.

### Spout of the Water Bottle for Toddler:

Toddler water bottles come in open spouts, straws or sippy cup styles. Your toddler could take strongly towards a specific opening type or be less picky. My three kids all varied on how picky they were.

An open spout bottle works great for an older toddler, but has drawbacks for a younger toddler, (think pouring out the water to make puddles to play in)!

### Size of the Toddler Water Bottle:

A smaller bottle which has fewer fluid ounces, is easier for little hands than a larger bottle. As your toddler gets older he/she might be able to upgrade to a larger bottle, but not the same size as an adult bottle. 

You want your toddler water bottle to be large enough for your child to stay hydrated but small enough to be manageable for them. A 10-16 ounce water bottle is manageable, a 20 ounce bottle is not.

### Spill Proof:

How much do you trust your toddler to not spill their water bottle? Different options on the market mean a variety of choices when considering spill proof.

An open spout can easily be spilled, but may have a lid you can pop on. Great for the older toddler, but a younger toddler might enjoy spilling it more!

A straw bottle might have a mechanism in place to reduce spills, how effective is it? All good things to consider when purchasing a water bottle for a toddler.

### Material of Toddler Water Bottle:

Safety first when thinking about your 1, 2, 3 or 4 year old. Your two main choices are stainless steel and plastic. 

Stainless steel is a more environmentally safe option that will keep the water colder. However, stainless steel weighs which is not always best for a young toddler.   

A plastic bottle will weigh significantly less. This makes it easier for a toddler to handle on their own. Also it will make less noise when dropped on the ground by those tiny hands. However, you will want to ensure the plastic used is safe, BPA free. 

A tritan plastic watter bottle is the [safest plastic in the world](https://www.clearlyfiltered.com/blogs/blog/why-we-use-tritan-plastic#:~\:text=%22Accredited%20universities%20and%20independent%20third,androgenic%20activity%20\(AA\).%22) making it the best choice for your toddler water bottle.

"Accredited universities and independent third-party labs tested Tritan, and the results overwhelmingly demonstrate that it is safe and, in separate studies, free of bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol S (BPS). Tritan plastic also is free of estrogenic activity (EA) and androgenic activity (AA)."

### Weight of Water Bottle for Toddlers

You are the one that will have to carry the water bottle around, most likely. The heavier a bottle the more weight you are carrying around. Again re-ethasising the plastic bottle or stainless steel for toddlers.

Or, if your toddler is older and can wear a backpack he or she might carry it. A lighter bottle will mean less complaining from an  older toddler.

## How Much Water Should a Toddler Drink in a Day?

This is determinant on the age of your toddler and how much other fluids he/she drinks.

According to the A[merican Academy of Pediatrics](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Choose-Water-for-Healthy-Hydration.aspx#:~\:text=To%20stay%20well%20hydrated%2C%20children,8%20cups%20for%20older%20children.) a 1-3 year old should drink 4 cups of fluid a day on average and a  4-8 year old should drink 5 cups of fluid a day on average. The fluids should be milk or water.  

If you are reading this you probably have a little adventurer and little adventurers need slightly more water than the average. A toddler will need more than average if exerting lots of energy, such as going on a [hike](/hiking-with-toddlers-ultimate-guide), and on hot humid days.

## ![14 month old daughter drinking her water bottle](http://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1689965818/one_year_old_water_bottle_skiphop_fd7mjr.jpg "14 month old daughter drinking her water bottle")Best Water Bottle for 1 Year Old:

A one year old will need a water bottle that fits in their tiny hands, making a small slimmer bottle the perfect choice. 

Also a 1 year old might need a bottle that doesn’t allow too much water at once. An opening that is small and lets out less liquid is ideal. Larger sips results in your 1 year old spitting out the excess water or inhaling too much and coughing.

The toddler water bottle opens with a button push and easily closes when the spout is pushed down.

## Best Water Bottle for 4 Year Old

As your toddler gets older they are increasing their skills. One skill is that a 4 year old is drinking from open cups more. A great way to practice and encourage this skill is by letting your older toddler have an open pour water bottle.

Open pour, scary I know, but it doesn’t mean it can’t be spill proof. A toddler water bottle that features an open spout, but also can be spill proof when closed is the perfect compromise.
