Scooters are great fun for 3 year olds. Scooters teach balance and steering and allows toddlers to fly off down the driveway and onto the sidewalks. They allow family walks to become more exciting. Scooters will give your toddler a streak of independence.

Scooters for 3 year olds are slightly different from the traditional scooter.

## Main Differences between A Toddler Scooters and An Older Child Scooters

### 3 wheels instead of 2

Toddlers are still learning balance and adding a third wheel to the mix greatly increases the stability of the scooter for a 3 year old. The extra wheel is best when configured up front to be two wheels with a single back wheel. When the back has two wheels the wheels often get in the way of a toddler’s foot when gliding.  There have been many complaints of the ankle coming into contact with the wheels.

### The scooter's footbed is wider

![best wide footbed scooter for 3 year old](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975398/3-year-old-best-overall-scooter-.jpg "The Skidee has a very wide foot bed")

A toddler will be learning and having a wider base on which to put their feet makes for an easier ride. 

### Handlebar adjustability

A toddler scooter will have a range of heights for the handlebar to accommodate a growing child. Adult scooters can have this as well, but a toddler scooter must have this, in my opinion. I am not buying a different scooter each year.

### Lean-to-steer technology

A scooter for an older child or an adult is turned by using the handlebars, however, in a toddler scooter all you have to do is lean in the direction you want to go. Leaning is designed to make scooters easier for toddlers to use. If a toddler had to turn the handlebar to steer, the ride would be more jerky and the toddler would be  more likely to fall off the scooter. Designing a stiffer handle that cannot turn reduces potential falls and increases stability for a toddler.

## Best Overall Scooter For A 3 Year Old

### Skidee Y200 light up scooter

If you are looking for the perfect scooter for a 3 year old, the **[Skidee scooter](https://www.amazon.com/Scooters-Suitable-Adjustable-Removable-Activities/dp/B07JBB6YJQ?crid=15IG86F4TJ89T\&keywords=skidee+scooter\&qid=1644690885\&s=sporting-goods\&sprefix=skidee+scoote%2Csporting%2C146\&sr=1-1-spons\&psc=1\&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFLSURMWUc4MjFXWCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRJZD1BMDkzMDYzODFJVlNJTDZERVVQS1omZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDczMzI1OTFUWVEzRlAyTVRHR0gmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=0041df35529bcd1024d146546d3628a0\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** is a solid choice. It is reasonably priced and comes with all the fun features a 3 year old (or 2 year old) would love.  

<AffiliateLink affiliateSnippet="" button={false} image="" imageURL="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B07JBB6YJQ&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&language=en_US" linkURL="https://www.amazon.com/Scooters-Suitable-Adjustable-Removable-Activities/dp/B07JBB6YJQ?crid=15IG86F4TJ89T&keywords=skidee+scooter&qid=1644690885&s=sporting-goods&sprefix=skidee+scoote%2Csporting%2C146&sr=1-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFLSURMWUc4MjFXWCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRJZD1BMDkzMDYzODFJVlNJTDZERVVQS1omZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDczMzI1OTFUWVEzRlAyTVRHR0gmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl&linkCode=li2&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=913f755170bbcb0e3db67bd3c1eb899b&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" />

The scooter comes with **a seat** that can be detached for when your child is older (seat weight limit is 44 lbs). I was skeptical if my toddlers really needed a seat option, but they both love having this option. I also love that I can remove the seat in the future.

![Light up scooter 3 year old](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975399/light-up-3-year-old-scooter.jpg "Bit blurry, however shows how the scooter's wheels lights up")

The **wheels light up** and change color depending on how fast you are riding your scooter. When riding near dusk or dawn I can always see my toddler zooming by thanks to the lights. Again a feature I wasn’t crazy about until I saw it in action. Also makes all the neighborhood kids jealous that their scooter doesn’t light up.

The scooter features a **wide footbed**, the widest of all options. It also has a wider than average foot brake. The wide foot break is key for me. It makes learning to brake and braking easier for my toddler, which is a big safety feature for me.

The scooter is one of the only ones that can **fold to one piece**. This makes it super easy to travel with when placed in the back of the car.

![best scooter for 3 year old folded](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds8uw7t44/image/upload/v1685975400/skidee-3-year-old-scooter-folded-position.jpg "Skidee Scooter in its folded position for travel")

Skidee handlebar ranges from 24.5-33 inches making this scooter suitable for a wide age range 2-12 years. My not even 2 year old also has no problems fitting on this scooter. The frame is aluminum and the company provides a **1 year warranty** on the product.

#### Pros of Skidee Y200 Scooter

* Removable seat
* Light-up wheels
* Wide foot bed and wide back brake
* Grips on handlebars
* Large range handlebar adjustability (8.5 inches)
* Fold up to one piece for storage and travel

#### Cons of Skidee Y200 Scooter

* Heavier scooter due to seat and wider options (7 lbs)

## Runner Up Best Overall Scooter For A 3 Year Old

### GOMO Kids Scooter 2-5 year old adjustable

If you are looking for a **faster scooter** I recommend the **[GOMO scooter.](https://www.amazon.com/GOMO-Wheel-Scooter-Toddler-Adjustable/dp/B07V25N3YC?keywords=gomo%2Bkids%2Bscooter%2B2-5%2Byears%2Bold\&qid=1644690958\&s=sporting-goods\&sprefix=gomo%2Bkids%2Bscoot%2Csporting%2C123\&sr=1-1-spons\&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFQUlBGM1RRUzRNRVAmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA1NzY3OTIzTEYwUUhKVUg1NEkxJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA2MDg5MjM2MUgxWEtUNEtSR1Amd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl\&th=1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=4c3cf820371e5d6e5a38fc331f477344\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** Your 3 year old will be flying down the road with this scooter's more streamline design. The scooter is similarly priced to the Skidee and offers slightly different features.

<AffiliateLink affiliateSnippet="" button={false} image="" imageURL="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B07V25N3YC&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&language=en_US" linkURL="https://www.amazon.com/GOMO-Wheel-Scooter-Toddler-Adjustable/dp/B07V25N3YC?keywords=gomo%2Bkids%2Bscooter%2B2-5%2Byears%2Bold&qid=1644690958&s=sporting-goods&sprefix=gomo%2Bkids%2Bscoot%2Csporting%2C123&sr=1-1-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFQUlBGM1RRUzRNRVAmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA1NzY3OTIzTEYwUUhKVUg1NEkxJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA2MDg5MjM2MUgxWEtUNEtSR1Amd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl&th=1&linkCode=li2&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=12d02ceba0f203fa09b224715dccb1a7&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" />

This scooter has a shorter range of handlebar height 26-31.5 inches making the scooter most suitable for a **2-5 year old** and not ranging as high as the Skidee. The scooter is more than a pound **lighter** due to the absence  of a seat and a slightly slimmer build, which makes this scooter fly! Also the company offers **one more year of warranty** than Skidee.

The scooter also features a sturdy aluminum frame, **light up wheels** and grips on the handlebars. The **foot bed is extra wide**, however the rear break is not as wide. 

The GOMO scooter has a **nose bumper** to protect the scooter. If it runs into another object no harm or scratches will appear. 

The scooter doesn’t fold and instead you have to disconnect the handlebar frame from the foot bed.

#### Pros of GOMO 2-5 Year Old Adjustable Scooter

* Light-up wheels
* Wide foot bed with grips
* Grips on handlebars
* Lightweight (\<6 lbs)

#### Cons of GOMO 2-5 Year Old Adjustable Scooter

* Does not fold for travel
* No option of a seat
* Less adjustability in handlebar height (5.5 inches)

## Best Budget Scooter For 3 Year Old

### Radio Flyer Lean N Glide Scooter with light up wheels

Purse strings being pulled?  Have no fear. This scooter is a great option scooter for a 3 year old and about **half the cost**. 

<AffiliateLink affiliateSnippet="" button={false} image="" imageURL="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B06XSTWYV9&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=allaboutmom06-20&language=en_US" linkURL="https://www.amazon.com/Radio-Flyer-Scooter-Wheels-Vehicle/dp/B06XSTWYV9?keywords=radio%2Bflyer%2Blean%2Bn%2Bglide%2Bscooter%2Bwith%2Blight%2Bup%2Bwheels&qid=1644691040&sprefix=radio%2Bflyer%2Blean%2Bn%2Bgl%2Caps%2C118&sr=8-2&th=1&linkCode=li2&tag=allaboutmom06-20&linkId=5c1a78e5d162c5c3679b4ff1e8c09385&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" />

The **[Radio Flyer Scooter](https://www.amazon.com/Radio-Flyer-Scooter-Wheels-Vehicle/dp/B06XSTWYV9?keywords=radio%2Bflyer%2Blean%2Bn%2Bglide%2Bscooter%2Bwith%2Blight%2Bup%2Bwheels\&qid=1644691040\&sprefix=radio%2Bflyer%2Blean%2Bn%2Bgl%2Caps%2C118\&sr=8-2\&th=1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=03f2ca06233e8009a6cd38e7b20292b8\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** is suitable for a **3 year old up to 7 year old** or max weight of 60 lbs. The adjustable handlebar height ranges from 25.5-33.25 inches which is greater than the GOMO option by just over 2 inches.

The wheels light up, foot bed is widened and the scooter is **lightweight at 5 lbs.** The design is more simple with a soft foam handlebar and no option for a seat or foldability. Options are limited to three colors red, blue and purple.

The main difference you will notice when compared to the other more expensive scooters is in the overall build and a less smooth ride. The plastic footbed is thin, brake pedal not as wide and sturdy, and the wheels not as strong. The weight max of this product is only 60 lbs compared to over 100 lbs in other brands.

My nephew on his Radio Flyer Scooter (his didn't have the light up wheels)

It will work great, but I am not sure you will get the longevity you wouldl get from some of the other brands nor the ability to pass it down to other siblings.

#### Pros of Radio Flyer Lean N Glide Scooter 

* Cheap
* Light-up wheels
* Lightweight (5 lbs)
* Adjustable handlebar Range 7.75 inches

#### Cons of Radio Flyer Lean N Glide Scooter

* No Seat Option
* Less wide foot brake
* Not as strongly built

The scooter is the **lightest option** at only 4.2 lbs and has a minimalistic construction that looks sleek and fashionable. Your toddler will have no issues carrying this scooter or handling it. The **wide foot bed** is made from reinforced flexible fiberglass that can withstand a maximum weight of **110lbs**. This scooter’s stem is anodised aluminum making it harder to scratch. The manufacturer guarantees a **2 year warranty**.

The scooter offers the **lowest handlebar height** at 17 inches and extends to 24 inches making it **perfect for a 2 year old** or even younger. You will be looking for a new scooter sooner since the child range is more narrow, but if you have several kids you can cycle through them.

I personally love this scooter. If my toddlers weren’t loving the seat option of the Skidee this would be my go to scooter.  The Micro also has a less wide base, but as you see in the picture a toddler's feet still fits.

* Anodised aluminum stem
* Minimalistic design

#### Cons of Micro Kickboard Mini Deluxe LED Scooter

## Can A 2 Year Old Scooter?

Yes, and my 21 month old son knows how to use his brother's scooter. The main component you will look for in a 2 year old scooter is the same features as a 3 year old scooter; wide footbed, right handlebar height, lean-to-steer technology and 3 wheels.

## What Is The Best Scooter For 2 Year Old?

The above scooters are all great options for a 2 year old. The larger the footbed the easier the scooter will be for a 2 year old.

The **[Skidee Scooter y200](https://www.amazon.com/Scooters-Suitable-Adjustable-Removable-Activities/dp/B07JBB6YJQ?crid=15IG86F4TJ89T\&keywords=skidee%2Bscooter\&qid=1644690885\&s=sporting-goods\&sprefix=skidee%2Bscoote%2Csporting%2C146\&sr=1-1-spons\&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFLSURMWUc4MjFXWCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRJZD1BMDkzMDYzODFJVlNJTDZERVVQS1omZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDczMzI1OTFUWVEzRlAyTVRHR0gmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl\&th=1\&psc=1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=cdafffb7695c5c334aa0c9fa9f7f694e\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** is a great first scooter. A 2 year old has the option to sit down when tired and have mom or dad pull them up a hill, something I have done on many occasions. The light up wheels make it fun and the scooter can grow with your 2 year old.

Another choice for a smaller 2 year old is the **[Micro Kickboard Mini 3in1 Deluxe](https://www.amazon.com/Deluxe-3-Stage-Micro-Scooter-Toddler/dp/B01BLJS43S?crid=26OAK64HDEJ8X\&keywords=micro%2Bmini%2Bdeluxe%2Bkick%2Bscooter\&qid=1571162137\&s=toys-and-games\&sprefix=micro%2Bmini%2Bdeluxe%2Ctoys-and-games%2C157\&sr=1-7\&th=1\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=713ecb005d838b10df3b068713e59c41\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)**. This scooter converts into 3 different stages with the earliest stage starting at 12 months. The scooter starts as a ride-on scooter, converts to a small scooter with O-bar handle and finally converts to a scooter with a T-bar handle.

The Micro Kickboard scooter is great for a 1 year old to start learning balance. The lightweight design makes it easy for a toddler to handle. The soft edges of the scooter make it possible to bring indoors as well as outdoors.

When older the handlebars will adjust up to grow with your child, up to the age of 5.

## Do Toddlers Need A Helmet To Ride A Scooter?

Yes, toddlers should wear a helmet when riding a scooter. Toddlers can fall off their scooter and to protect their head a helmet should be worn.

Make sure a toddlers helmet is the right size for your toddler and is securely fitted to their head. My two toddlers both have an **[Ouwoer's Kids Bike Helmet](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CXL2NCT?ie=UTF8\&linkCode=ll1\&tag=allaboutmom06-20\&linkId=a24093f5c3df94eeb81cc0647b77c932\&language=en_US\&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)**. This helmet is great for my toddlers; it has an adjustable chin strap, adjuster on the back of the helmet to tighten or loosen the fit and additional foam supports.

Below is a helpful video on how to properly fit a toddler's helmet.

## How Do You Teach A Toddler To Ride A Scooter?

The best way to teach a toddler to ride a scooter is by example. Perhaps the neighbor, older sibling or kids at the park rides a scooter. Talk to your toddler about what they are doing and gauge their interest.You can watch a video together on youtube demonstrating how to ride a scooter.

Once the concept is in your toddlers mind then practice with their own scooter. As a parent you will want to talk through the steps, but also let your child explore on their own. Keep your conversation positive and praise your little one for progress made.

In no time your toddler will be flying down the streets on their scooter!

Hope this helps you decide what scooter is best for your toddler!
